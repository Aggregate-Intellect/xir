0,Q0,HOW AFRICAN AMERICANS WERE IMMIGRATED TO THE US,African American immigrated to the US,African immigration to the United States,"African immigration to the United States refers to immigrants to the United States who are or were nationals of Africa . The term African in the scope of this article refers to geographical or national origins rather than racial affiliation. From the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 to 2007, an estimated total of 0.8 to 0.9 million Africans immigrated to the United States, accounting for roughly 3.3% of total immigration to the United States during this period. African immigrants in the United States come from almost all regions in Africa and do not constitute a homogeneous group. They include people from different national, linguistic, ethnic, racial, cultural and social backgrounds. As such, African immigrants are to be distinguished from African American people, the latter of whom are descendants of mostly West and Central Africans who were involuntarily brought to the United States by means of the historic Atlantic slave trade .","As such, African immigrants are to be distinguished from African American people, the latter of whom are descendants of mostly West and Central Africans who were involuntarily brought to the United States by means of the historic Atlantic slave trade ."
1,Q4,how a water pump works,water pump works,Pump,"A small, electrically powered pump. A large, electrically driven pump (electropump) for waterworks near the Hengsteysee , Germany . A pump is a device that moves fluids ( liquids or gases ), or sometimes slurries , by mechanical action. Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid: direct lift, displacement, and gravity pumps. Pumps operate by some mechanism (typically reciprocating or rotary ), and consume energy to perform mechanical work by moving the fluid. Pumps operate via many energy sources, including manual operation, electricity, engines , or wind power .","Pumps operate by some mechanism (typically reciprocating or rotary ), and consume energy to perform mechanical work by moving the fluid."
2,Q20,how old was sue lyon when she made lolita,Sue Lyon's age when she made lolita,Lolita (1962 film),"Lolita is a 1962 comedy-drama film by Stanley Kubrick based on the classic novel of the same title by Vladimir Nabokov , centres around a middle-aged man who becomes obsessed with a teenage girl. The film stars James Mason as Humbert Humbert, Sue Lyon as Dolores Haze (Lolita) and Shelley Winters as Charlotte Haze with Peter Sellers as Clare Quilty. Due to the MPAA 's restrictions at the time , the film toned down the more provocative aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination. The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon , was fourteen at the time of filming. Kubrick later commented that, had he realized how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, he probably never would have made the film.","The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon , was fourteen at the time of filming."
3,Q33,how are antibodies used in,antibodies used in,antibody,"Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key. An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses . The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen . Each tip of the ""Y"" of an antibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell . Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms. Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably. Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains . There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.","An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses .

10,Q132,how is whooping cough distinguished from similar diseases,whooping cough distinguished from similar diseases,Pertussis,"Pertussis — commonly called whooping cough ( or ) — is a highly contagious bacterial disease caused by Bordetella pertussis . In some countries, this disease is called the 100 days' cough or cough of 100 days. Symptoms are initially mild, and then develop into severe coughing fits, which produce the namesake high-pitched ""whoop"" sound in infected babies and children when they inhale air after coughing. The coughing stage lasts approximately six weeks before subsiding. Prevention by vaccination is of primary importance given the seriousness of the disease in children. Although treatment is of little direct benefit to the person infected, antibiotics are recommended because they shorten the duration of infectiousness. It is estimated that the disease currently affects 48.5 million people yearly, resulting in nearly 295,000 deaths.

12,Q146,what causes heart disease,cause of heart disease,Cardiovascular disease,"Cardiovascular disease (also called heart disease) is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels ( arteries , capillaries , and veins ). Cardiovascular disease refers to any disease that affects the cardiovascular system , principally cardiac disease, vascular diseases of the brain and kidney , and peripheral arterial disease. The causes of cardiovascular disease are diverse but atherosclerosis and/or hypertension are the most common. Additionally, with aging come a number of physiological and morphological changes that alter cardiovascular function and lead to subsequently increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even in healthy asymptomatic individuals. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of deaths worldwide, though since the 1970s, cardiovascular mortality rates have declined in many high-income countries . At the same time, cardiovascular deaths and disease have increased at a fast rate in low- and middle-income countries. Although cardiovascular disease usually affects older adults, the antecedents of cardiovascular disease, notably atherosclerosis, begin in early life, making primary prevention efforts necessary from childhood. There is therefore increased emphasis on preventing atherosclerosis by modifying risk factors, such as healthy eating , exercise , and avoidance of smoking .",The causes of cardiovascular disease are diverse but atherosclerosis and/or hypertension are the most common.

The history of immigration to the United States is a continuing story of peoples from more populated continents, particularly Europe and also Africa and Asia, crossing oceans to the new land. Historians do not treat the first indigenous settlers as immigrants. Starting around 1600 British and other Europeans settled primarily on the east coast . Later Africans were brought as slaves. During the nation's history , the growing country experienced successive waves of immigration which rose and fell over time, particularly from Europe, with the cost of transoceanic transportation sometimes paid by travelers becoming indentured servants after their arrival in the New World. At other times, immigration rules became more restrictive. With the ending of numerical restrictions in 1965 and the advent of cheap air travel immigration has increased from Asia and Latin America.

18,Q300,how is jerky made,make jerky,Jerky,"Spiced strips of jerky. Jerky is lean meat that has been trimmed of fat, cut into strips, and then dried to prevent spoilage. Normally, this drying includes the addition of salt, to prevent bacteria from developing on the meat before sufficient moisture has been removed. The word ""jerky"" is derived from the Spanish word charqui which is from the Quechua word ch'arki. which means to burn (meat). All that is needed to produce basic ""jerky"" is a low-temperature drying method, and salt to inhibit bacterial growth. Modern manufactured jerky is normally marinated in a seasoned spice rub or liquid, and dried, dehydrated or smoked with low heat (usually under 70 °C/160 °F). Some makers still use just salt and sun-dry fresh sliced meat to make jerky. Some product manufacturers finely grind meat, mix in seasonings, and press the meat-paste into flat shapes prior to drying. The resulting jerky from the above methods would be a salty and/or savory snack. However, often a sweet or semi-sweet recipe is used, with sugar being a major ingredient (in contrast to biltong which is a dried meat product that utilizes the acid in vinegar rather than salt to inhibit bacterial growth when drying the meat). Jerky is ready-to-eat and needs no additional preparation. It can be stored for months without refrigeration . When the protein to moisture content ratio is correct, the resulting meat is cured , or preserved. There are many products in the marketplace which are sold as jerky which consist of highly processed, chopped and formed meat, rather than traditional sliced, whole-muscle meat. These products may contain more fat, but moisture content, like the whole-muscle product, must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture to protein ratio in the US. Chemical preservatives can be used to prevent oxidative spoilage, but the moisture to protein ratio prevents microbial spoilage by low water activity . Many jerky products are very high in sugar and are therefore very sweet, unlike biltong, which rarely contains added sugars. A typical 30 g portion of fresh jerky contains 10-15 g of protein, 1 g of fat, and 0-3 g of carbohydrates. Since traditional jerky recipes use a basic salt cure, sodium can be a concern for some people. A 30 g serving of jerky could contain more than 600 mg of sodium, which would be about 30% of the recommended USRDA .","Jerky is lean meat that has been trimmed of fat, cut into strips, and then dried to prevent spoilage.

19,Q309,what did tycho brahe do,tycho brahe do,Tycho Brahe,"Monument of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler in Prague. Tycho Brahe (14 December 154624 October 1601), born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations. He was born in Scania , then part of Denmark, now part of modern-day Sweden. Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer and alchemist . In his De nova stella (On the new star) of 1573, he refuted the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging celestial realm . His precise measurements indicated that ""new stars,"" (stellae novae , now known as supernovae ) in particular that of 1572 , lacked the parallax expected in sub-lunar phenomena, and were therefore not ""atmospheric"" tailless comets as previously believed, but were above the atmosphere and moon. Using similar measurements he showed that comets were also not atmospheric phenomena, as previously thought, and must pass through the supposedly ""immutable"" celestial spheres . As an astronomer, Tycho worked to combine what he saw as the geometrical benefits of the Copernican system with the philosophical benefits of the Ptolemaic system into his own model of the universe, the Tychonic system . Furthermore, he was the last of the major naked eye astronomers, working without telescopes for his observations. Tycho Brahe was granted an estate on the island of Hven and the funding to build the Uraniborg , an early research institute , where he built large astronomical instruments and took many careful measurements, and later Stjerneborg , underground, when he discovered that his instruments in the former were not sufficiently steady. On the island (on which he demonstrated autocratic character and behavior toward the residents) he founded manufactories such as paper-making to provide material for printing his results. After disagreements with the new Danish king Christian IV in 1597, he was invited by the Bohemian king and Holy Roman emperor Rudolph II to Prague, where he became the official imperial astronomer. He built the new observatory at Benátky nad Jizerou . Here, from 1600 until his death in 1601, he was assisted by Johannes Kepler who later used Tycho's astronomical data to develop Kepler's laws of planetary motion .","Tycho Brahe (14 December 154624 October 1601), born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations.

28,Q384,what can be powered by wind,powered by wind,Wind power,"Burbo Bank Offshore Wind Farm , at the entrance to the River Mersey in North West England. The Shepherds Flat Wind Farm is a 845 megawatt (MW) wind farm in the U.S. state of Oregon . Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electrical power , windmills for mechanical power, wind pumps for water pumping or drainage , or sails to propel ships. Large wind farms consist of hundreds of individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms provide electricity to isolated locations. Utility companies increasingly buy surplus electricity produced by small domestic wind turbines. Wind power, as an alternative to fossil fuels , is plentiful, renewable , widely distributed, clean , produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation and uses little land. The effects on the environment are generally less problematic than those from other power sources. As of 2011, Denmark is generating more than a quarter of its electricity from wind and 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis. In 2010 wind energy production was over 2.5% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing rapidly at more than 25% per annum. The monetary cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations. Wind power is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales. The intermittency of wind seldom creates problems when used to supply up to 20% of total electricity demand, but as the proportion increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur. Power management techniques such as having excess capacity storage, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing sources, storage such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity , exporting and importing power to neighboring areas or reducing demand when wind production is low, can greatly mitigate these problems. In addition, weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur.","Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy, such as using wind turbines to make electrical power , windmills for mechanical power, wind pumps for water pumping or drainage , or sails to propel ships."

36,Q568,how much of our universe does plasma make up,our universe that plasma make up,Plasma (physics),"Plasma (from Greek πλάσμα, ""anything formed"") is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid , liquid , and gas ). Heating a gas may ionize its molecules or atoms (reducing or increasing the number of electrons in them), thus turning it into a plasma, which contains charged particles: positive ions and negative electrons or ions. Ionization can be induced by other means, such as strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator, and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds , if present. The presence of a non-negligible number of charge carriers makes the plasma electrically conductive so that it responds strongly to electromagnetic fields . Plasma, therefore, has properties quite unlike those of solids , liquids , or gases and is considered a distinct state of matter . Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container; unlike gas, under the influence of a magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and double layers . Some common plasmas are found in stars and neon signs . In the universe , plasma is the most common state of matter for ordinary matter , most of which is in the rarefied intergalactic plasma (particularly intracluster medium ) and in stars. Much of the understanding of plasmas has come from the pursuit of controlled nuclear fusion and fusion power , for which plasma physics provides the scientific basis.","In the universe , plasma is the most common state of matter for ordinary matter , most of which is in the rarefied intergalactic plasma (particularly intracluster medium ) and in stars."

39,Q583,how many days are in a leap year,days that are in a leap year,Leap year,"A leap year (or intercalary or bissextile year) is a year containing one additional day (or, in the case of lunisolar calendars , a month) in order to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year . Because seasons and astronomical events do not repeat in a whole number of days, a calendar that had the same number of days in each year would, over time, drift with respect to the event it was supposed to track. By occasionally inserting (or intercalating ) an additional day or month into the year, the drift can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is called a common year . For example, in the Gregorian calendar (a common solar calendar), February in a leap year has 29 days instead of the usual 28, so the year lasts 366 days instead of the usual 365. Similarly, in the Hebrew calendar (a lunisolar calendar), Adar Aleph , a 13th lunar month is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. The term leap year gets its name from the fact that while a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, in a leap year the day of the week will advance two days (from March onwards) due to the year's extra day inserted at the end of February (thus ""leaping over"" one of the days in the week). For example, Christmas Day fell on Saturday in 2004, Sunday in 2005, Monday in 2006 and Tuesday in 2007 but then ""leapt"" over Wednesday to fall on a Thursday in 2008.","For example, in the Gregorian calendar (a common solar calendar), February in a leap year has 29 days instead of the usual 28, so the year lasts 366 days instead of the usual 365."

After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific , Kennedy represented Massachusetts' 11th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat . Thereafter, he served in the U.S. Senate from 1953 until 1960. Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election . At 43 years of age, he is the youngest to have been elected to the office, the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt ), and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president. A Catholic , Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president, and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize . Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the building of the Berlin Wall , the Space Race , the African-American Civil Rights Movement , and early stages of the Vietnam War . Therein, Kennedy increased the number of military advisers, special operation forces, and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia. The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government. It involved certain forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas , Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later, before a trial could take place. The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin. However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy . However, ABC News in their investigation, The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy, confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission; having concluded Oswald acted alone. Kennedy's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970. Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light. Details of Kennedy's health problems in which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s. Although initially kept secret from the general public, reports of Kennedy's philandering have garnered much press.

U.S. President George H. W. Bush deployed U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia , and urged other countries to send their own forces to the scene. An array of nations joined the Coalition. The great majority of the Coalition's military forces were from the U.S., with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order. Saudi Arabia paid around US$36 billion of the US$60 billion cost. The war was marked by the beginning of live news on the front lines of the fight, with the primacy of the U.S. network CNN . The war has also earned the nickname Video Game War after the daily broadcast images on board the U.S. bombers during Operation Desert Storm. The initial conflict to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait began with an aerial bombardment on 17 January 1991. This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February. This was a decisive victory for the Coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory. The Coalition ceased their advance, and declared a cease-fire 100 hours after the ground campaign started. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia's border.

55,Q757,how many players on a side for a football game,players on side for football game,American football,"American football, known in the United States as football, is a team sport . It is played by two teams, eleven players to a side, who advance an oval ball over a rectangular field that is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide and has goalposts at both ends. The team in possession of the ball (the offense) attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball. To continue their drive, the offense must advance the ball at least 10 yards down the field in a series of four downs . If they succeed, they receive a new set of four downs to continue their drive. Otherwise, they lose control of the ball to the opposing team. The offense can score points by advancing the ball into the end zone (a touchdown ) or by kicking the ball through the opponent's goalpost (a field goal ), while the defense can score points by forcing an offensive turnover and advancing the ball into the offense's end zone or by tackling the ballcarrier in the offense's end zone (a safety ). The team that has scored the most points by the end of the game wins. American football evolved from early forms of rugby , particularly rugby union , and association football (soccer). The first game was played on November 6, 1869 under a set of rules resembling those of rugby and soccer. A set of rule changes instituted from 1880 onward by Walter Camp established the snap , eleven-player teams and downs . Later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone and specified the width of the football. American football is the most popular sport in the United States today, and the National Football League (NFL) is its most popular league. The league's championship, the Super Bowl , is among the most-watched club sporting events in the world.","It is played by two teams, eleven players to a side, who advance an oval ball over a rectangular field that is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide and has goalposts at both ends."
56,Q763,how long to take iwo jima,time to take Iwo Jima,Battle of Iwo Jima,"The Battle of Iwo Jima (19 February – 26 March 1945), or Operation Detachment, was a major battle in which the United States Armed Forces fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire . The American invasion had the goal of capturing the entire island, including its three airfields , to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands. This month-long battle included some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the War in the Pacific of World War II. The Imperial Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified , with a dense network of bunkers , hidden artillery positions, and of underground tunnels. The Americans on the ground were aided by extensive naval artillery and the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators had complete air supremacy over Iwo Jima from the beginning of the battle. American seapower and airpower were capable of delivering vast amounts of fire onto the Japanese troops. This invasion was the first American attack on Japanese home territory , and the Japanese soldiers and marines defended their positions tenaciously with no thought of surrender. The Japanese general in charge never considered surrendering to the Americans to save his men, and he and his officers had vowed to fight to the death, no matter how hopeless their battle was. Iwo Jima was also the only battle by the U.S. Marine Corps in which the overall American casualties (killed and wounded) exceeded those of the Japanese, although Japanese combat deaths were thrice those of the Americans throughout the battle. Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner. Some of them were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled. The rest were killed or missing and presumed dead. Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides, the Japanese defeat was assured from the start. The Americans possessed an overwhelming superiority in arms and numbers. These factors, coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, ensured that there were no plausible circumstances in which the Americans could have lost the battle. The battle was immortalized by Joe Rosenthal 's photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag on top of the Mount Suribachi by five U.S. Marines and one U.S. Navy battlefield Hospital Corpsman . The photograph records the second flag-raising on the mountain, both of which took place on the fifth day of the 35-day battle. The picture became the iconic image of the battle and it has been widely reproduced.","The Battle of Iwo Jima (19 February – 26 March 1945), or Operation Detachment, was a major battle in which the United States Armed Forces fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire ."
57,Q771,what creates a cloud,creation of a cloud,Cloud,"Stratocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus. In meteorology , a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols . Clouds in Earth's atmosphere are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology . Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated; cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. In general, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga , which evaporates before reaching the surface. The international cloud classification system is based on the fact clouds in their most basic forms can show free-convective upward growth like cumulus , appear in non-convective layered sheets such as stratus , or take the form of thin fibrous wisps, as in the case of cirrus . Prefixes are used in connection with clouds to express variations or complexities in these basic forms or to specify middle or high altitude ranges. These include strato- for low clouds with limited convection that form mostly in uneven layers, cumulo- for complex highly-convective storm clouds, nimbo- for thick layered clouds of some complexity that can produce moderate to heavy precipitation, alto- for middle clouds, and cirro- for high clouds; the latter two of which may be of simple or moderately complex structure. Whether or not a cloud is low, middle, or high level depends on how far above the ground its base forms. Cloud types with significant vertical extent can form in the low or middle altitude ranges depending on the moisture content of the air. Clouds in the troposphere have Latin names due to the popular adaptation of Luke Howard 's cloud categorization system, which began to spread in popularity during December 1802. Synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds. While a majority of clouds form in Earth's troposphere, there are occasions when clouds in the stratosphere and mesosphere can be observed. These three main layers of the atmosphere where clouds may be seen are collectively known as the homosphere . Above this lies the thermosphere and exosphere , which together make up the heterosphere that marks the transition to outer space . Clouds have been observed on other planets and moons within the Solar System , but, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are composed of other substances such as methane , ammonia , and sulfuric acid .","In meteorology , a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body."

For the original stadium, on the south side of 161st Street, go to Yankee Stadium (1923) . Yankee Stadium is a stadium located in The Bronx in New York City. It is the home ballpark for the New York Yankees , one of the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) franchises. It opened at the beginning of the 2009 MLB season as a replacement for the team's previous home, the original Yankee Stadium , which opened in 1923 and closed in 2008. The new ballpark was constructed across the street, north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park . The ballpark opened April 2, 2009, when the Yankees hosted a workout day in front of fans from the Bronx community. The first game at the new Yankee Stadium was a pre-season exhibition game against the Chicago Cubs played on April 3, 2009, which the Yankees won 7–4. The first regular season game was played on April 16, a 10–2 Yankee loss to the Cleveland Indians . Much of the stadium incorporates design elements from the previous Yankee Stadium, thus paying homage to Yankee history.

63,Q900,What happened during the Starving Time in Jamestown?,starving time in Jamestown,Starving Time,"The Starving Time at Jamestown in the Colony of Virginia was a period of starvation during the winter of 1609–1610 in which all but 60 of 500 colonists died. The colonists, the first group of whom had originally arrived at Jamestown on May 14, 1607, had never planned to grow all of their own food. Their plans depended upon trade with the local Native Americans' Powhatan Confederacy to supply them with food between the arrivals of periodic supply ships from England. Lack of access to water and a relatively dry rain season crippled the agricultural production of the colonists. Also, the water that the colonists drank was brackish and only drinkable half the year. A fleet from England, damaged by a hurricane, arrived months behind schedule with new colonists, but without expected food supplies. On June 7, 1610 the survivors boarded ships, abandoned the colony site, and sailed towards the Chesapeake Bay , where another supply convoy with new supplies and headed by a newly appointed governor, Thomas West, Baron De La Warr , intercepted them on the lower James River and returned them to Jamestown. Within a few years, the commercialization of tobacco by John Rolfe secured the settlement's long-term economic prosperity. There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time.","Lack of access to water and a relatively dry rain season crippled the agricultural production of the colonists.

67,Q990,what does continuous improvement mean,continuous improvement meaning,Continual improvement process,"A continual improvement process, also often called a continuous improvement process (abbreviated as CIP or CI), is an ongoing effort to improve products, services, or processes. These efforts can seek ""incremental"" improvement over time or ""breakthrough"" improvement all at once. Delivery (customer valued) processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility. Some see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems (such as business process management , quality management , project management , and program management ). W. Edwards Deming , a pioneer of the field, saw it as part of the 'system' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against organisational goals. The fact that it can be called a management process does not mean that it needs to be executed by 'management'; but rather merely that it makes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design of the delivery process itself.","A continual improvement process, also often called a continuous improvement process (abbreviated as CIP or CI), is an ongoing effort to improve products, services, or processes."
68,Q1012,what are points on a mortgage,points on mortgage,Point (mortgage),"Points, sometimes also called a ""discount point"", are a form of pre-paid interest . One point equals one percent of the loan amount. By charging a borrower points, a lender effectively increases the yield on the loan above the amount of the stated interest rate . Borrowers can offer to pay a lender points as a method to reduce the interest rate on the loan, thus obtaining a lower monthly payment in exchange for this up-front payment. For each point purchased, the loan rate is typically reduced by 1/8% (0.125%). Paying Points represent a calculated gamble on the part of the buyer. There will be a specific point in the timeline of the loan where the money spent to buy down the interest rate will be equal to the money saved by making reduced loan payments resulting from the lower interest rate on the loan. Selling the property or refinancing prior to this break-even point will result in a net financial loss for the buyer while keeping the loan for longer than this break-even point will result in a net financial savings for the buyer. The longer you keep the property financed under the loan with purchased points, the more the money spent on the points will pay off. Accordingly, if the intention is to buy and sell the property or refinance in a rapid fashion, buying points is actually going to end up costing more than just paying the loan at the higher interest rate. Points may also be purchased to reduce the monthly payment for the purpose of qualifying for a loan. Loan qualification based on monthly income versus the monthly loan payment may sometimes only be achievable by reducing the monthly payment through the purchasing of points to buy down the interest rate, thereby reducing the monthly loan payment. Discount points may be different from origination fee or broker fee . Discount points are always used to buy down the interest rates, while origination fees sometimes are fees the lender charges for the loan or sometimes just another name for buying down the interest rate. Origination fee and discount points are both items listed under lender-charges on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement . The difference in savings over the life of the loan can make paying points a benefit to the borrower. If you intend to stay in your home for an extended period of time, it may be worthwhile to pay additional points in order to obtain a lower interest rate. Any significant changes in fees should be re-disclosed in the final good faith estimate (GFE). Also directly related to points is the concept of the ' no closing cost loan '.

69,Q1027,WHAT IS A FY QUARTER,fiscal year quarter,Fiscal year,"A fiscal year (or financial year, or sometimes budget year) is a period used for calculating annual (""yearly"") financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting and taxation require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the period reported on constitutes a calendar year (that is, 1 January to 31 December). Fiscal years vary between businesses and countries. The ""fiscal year"" may also refer to the year used for income tax reporting. Some companies choose to end their fiscal year on the same day of the week, such day being the one closest to a particular date (for example, the Friday closest to 31 December). Under such a system, some fiscal years will have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks. Major corporations that adopt this approach include Cisco Systems . In the United Kingdom, a number of major corporations that were once government owned, such as BT Group and the National Grid , continue to use the government's financial year, which ends on the last day of March, as they have found no reason to change since privatisation . Nevertheless, the fiscal year is identical to the calendar year for about 65% of publicly traded companies in the United States and for a majority of large corporations in the UK and elsewhere (with notable exceptions Australia, New Zealand and Japan). Many universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer, both to align the fiscal year with the school year (and, in some cases involving public universities, with the state government's fiscal year), and because the school is normally less busy during the summer months. In the Northern hemisphere this is July in one year to June in the next year. In the southern hemisphere this is January to December of a single calendar year. Some media/communication based organizations use a broadcast calendar as the basis for their fiscal year.","A fiscal year (or financial year, or sometimes budget year) is a period used for calculating annual (""yearly"") financial statements in businesses and other organizations."
70,Q1032,who wrote a rose is a rose is a rose,author a rose is a rose is a rose,Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose,"Gertrude Stein , 1935. The sentence ""Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."" was written by Gertrude Stein as part of the 1913 poem Sacred Emily, which appeared in the 1922 book Geography and Plays. In that poem, the first ""Rose"" is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and ""A rose is a rose is a rose"" is probably her most famous quotation, often interpreted as meaning ""things are what they are,"" a statement of the law of identity , ""A is A"". In Stein's view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the rose as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked ""Now listen! I’m no fool. I know that in daily life we don't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ...' Yes, I’m no fool; but I think that in that line the rose is red for the first time in English poetry for a hundred years."". (Four in America). She herself said to an audience at Oxford University that the statement referred to the fact that when the Romantics used the word ""rose"" it had a direct relationship to an actual rose. For later periods in literature this would no longer be true. The eras following romanticism, notably the modern era, use the word rose to refer to the actual rose, yet they also imply, through the use of the word, the archetypical elements of the romantic era.","The sentence ""Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose."" was written by Gertrude Stein as part of the 1913 poem Sacred Emily, which appeared in the 1922 book Geography and Plays."
71,Q1033,what is a notary for,notary for ,Notary public,"An embossed foil Notary Seal from the State of New York . A notary public (or notary or public notary) in the common law world is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business. A notary's main functions are to administer oaths and affirmations, take affidavits and statutory declarations , witness and authenticate the execution of certain classes of documents, take acknowledgments of deeds and other conveyances, protest notes and bills of exchange, provide notice of foreign drafts, prepare marine or ship's protests in cases of damage, provide exemplifications and notarial copies, and perform certain other official acts depending on the jurisdiction . Any such act is known as a notarization. The term notary public only refers to common-law notaries and should not be confused with civil-law notaries . With the exceptions of Louisiana , Puerto Rico , Quebec , whose private law is based on civil law , and British Columbia , whose notarial tradition stems from scrivener notary practice, a notary public in the rest of the United States and most of Canada has powers that are far more limited than those of civil-law or other common-law notaries, both of whom are qualified lawyers admitted to the bar: such notaries may be referred to as notaries-at-law or lawyer notaries. Therefore, at common law, notarial service is distinct from the practice of law , and giving legal advice and preparing legal instruments is forbidden to lay notaries such as those appointed throughout most of the United States of America.","A notary public (or notary or public notary) in the common law world is a public officer constituted by law to serve the public in non-contentious matters usually concerned with estates, deeds, powers-of-attorney, and foreign and international business.

74,Q1067,what percentage of water in in the body,percentage of water in body,Body water,"In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body . A significant fraction of the human body is water. Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that ""the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight. In a newborn infant, this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight, but it progressively decreases from birth to old age, most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life. Also, obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body, sometimes to as low as 45 percent"". These figures are statistical averages, so are illustrative, and like all biostatistics, will vary with things like type of population, age and number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure. For example, Jackson's (1985) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60% for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water, which approximates Guyton's 57%. In diseased states where body water is affected, the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem. Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide . Per Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology, body water is broken down into the following compartments:. Intracellular fluid (2/3 of body water). Per Guyton, in a body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5% (5/8), close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb. Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular. Extracellular fluid (1/3 of body water). Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5% Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here. Plasma (1/5 of extracellular fluid). Per Guyton's illustration, of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid, plasma volume averages 3 litres. This amounts to 20%, the same as per Netter's Atlas. Interstitial fluid (4/5 of extracellular fluid). Transcellular fluid (a.k.a. ""third space,"" normally ignored in calculations). Contained inside organs, such as the gastrointestinal , cerebrospinal , peritoneal, and ocular fluids.","Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that ""the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight.

78,Q1103,what state was john mccain a senator in during the 2008 election,state john mccain senator during 2008 election,"United States presidential election, 2008","The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008. Democrat Barack Obama , then the junior Senator from Illinois , defeated Republican John McCain , the senior Senator from Arizona . As the campaign progressed, the War in Iraq and outgoing Republican President George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular, and the major-party candidates ran on a platform of change and reform. Domestic policy and the economy eventually emerged as the main themes in the last few months of the election campaign after the onset of the worst recession since the 1930s . Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain in both the electoral and popular vote. Obama received the most votes for a presidential candidate in American history, and won the popular and electoral vote by the largest margin in 12 years , as well as the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century . This was the first U.S. presidential election in which an African American was elected, having also been the first in which an African American won the nomination of either major party. This election was also notable for being the first time in U.S. history that both major party candidates were sitting U.S. Senators, only the third time (after 1920 and 1960 ) that any sitting U.S. Senator was elected president, and only the second time that the winning President and Vice President (Obama and Biden) were both sitting U.S. Senators.

79,Q1154,where do crocodiles live,crocodiles live,Crocodile,"Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic tetrapods that live throughout the tropics in Africa , Asia , the Americas and Australia . Crocodylinae, in which all its members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily . A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae , that includes the tomistoma , was excluded in this article since new genetic studies reveal the possibility of tomistoma as a close relative of the gharial . This article applies the term crocodile only to the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia : which includes all members of Crocodylidae, including the tomistoma , the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae ) and the gharials (family Gavialidae ), and the rest of Crocodylomorpha , which includes all of the prehistoric crocodile relatives and ancestors. Although they appear to be similar to the untrained eye, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to seperate biological families . The gharial having a very unique and narrow snout is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators . The most obvious external differences are visible in the head with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator; which possesses small depressions in the upper jaw where the lower teeth fit into. Also when the crocodile's mouth is closed, the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the family , the species belongs to. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present but non-functioning in alligators. Another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians, are the much higher levels of aggression . All reptiles , with the exception of Testudines , are all scaled diapsids , but crocodilians are archosaurs , which means they are genetically closer to birds and the extinct dinosaurs , than other reptiles are. Although all crocodiles are anatomically and biologically similar; their size , morphology , behavior and ecology somewhat differs between species . However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers , lakes , wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater . They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , birds and mammals , and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans , depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold . They first separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago. A lineage, including the rest of Crocodylomorpha , have been around for at least 225 million years, survived multiple mass extinctions , but today, due to habitat destruction and poaching , many species are at the risk of extinction , some being classified as critically endangered .","Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large aquatic tetrapods that live throughout the tropics in Africa , Asia , the Americas and Australia ."
80,Q1157,what relates to erosion,related to erosion,Erosion,"A natural arch produced by the erosion of differentially weathered rock in Jebel Kharaz, Jordan. Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth's surface by exogenetic processes such as wind or water flow, and then transported and deposited in other locations. While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased by 10-40 times the rate at which erosion is occurring globally. Excessive erosion causes problems such as desertification , decreases in agricultural productivity due to land degradation, sedimentation of waterways, and ecological collapse due to loss of the nutrient rich upper soil layers . Water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation ; combined, they are responsible for 84% of degraded acreage, making excessive erosion one of the most significant global environmental problems. Industrial agriculture , deforestation , roads , anthropogenic climate change and urban sprawl are amongst the most significant human activities in regard to their effect on stimulating erosion. However, there are many available alternative land use practices that can curtail or limit erosion, such as terrace -building, no-till agriculture, and revegetation of denuded soils.","Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth's surface by exogenetic processes such as wind or water flow, and then transported and deposited in other locations.

His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy""), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics . Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus . Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries. It also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles. By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos. Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum . He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound . In addition to his work on the calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, and developed Newton's method for approximating the roots of a function . Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge . He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England , perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism . In addition to his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology , but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. In his later life, Newton became president of the Royal Society .

Methamphetamine occurs in two enantiomers , dextrorotary and levorotary ; dextromethamphetamine possesses the well-known psychostimulant effects of the drug, while levomethamphetamine is CNS -inactive. Although rarely prescribed, methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity under the trade name Desoxyn. Illicitly, methamphetamine may be sold either as pure dextromethamphetamine or in a racemic mixture. Both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are Schedule II controlled substances in the United States, and similarly the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many jurisdictions . Internationally, methamphetamine has been placed in Schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty. In low dosages, methamphetamine can increase alertness, concentration, and energy in fatigued individuals. In higher doses, it can induce mania with accompanying euphoria , feelings of self-esteem and increased libido . Methamphetamine has a high potential for abuse and addiction , activating the psychological reward system by triggering a cascading release of dopamine in the brain characterized as Amphetamine/ Stimulant psychosis . Chronic abuse may also lead to post-withdrawal syndrome , a result of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons . Post-withdrawal syndrome can persist beyond the withdrawal period for months, and sometimes up to a year. In addition to psychological harm, physical harm – primarily consisting of cardiovascular damage – may occur with chronic use or acute overdose.","Although rarely prescribed, methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity under the trade name Desoxyn."
87,Q1211,Where does the word baptism come from,word baptism origin,Baptism,"Baptism of Neophytes by Masaccio , 15th century, Brancacci Chapel , Florence . Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma; itself derived from βαπτισμός baptismos, washing) is a Christian rite of admission (or adoption ), almost invariably with the use of water, into the Christian Church generally and also a particular church tradition. Baptism has been called a sacrament and an ordinance of Jesus Christ. In some traditions, baptism is also called christening, but for others the word ""christening"" is reserved for the baptism of infants . The New Testament reports that Jesus was baptized . The usual form of baptism among the earliest Christians was for the naked candidate to be immersed totally (submersion) or partially (standing or kneeling in water while water was poured on him or her). While John the Baptist 's use of a deep river for his baptism suggests immersion, pictorial and archaeological evidence of Christian baptism from the 3rd century onward indicates that a normal form was to have the candidate stand in water while water was poured over the upper body. Other common forms of baptism now in use include pouring water three times on the forehead. Martyrdom was identified early in Church history as ""baptism by blood"", enabling martyrs who had not been baptized by water to be saved. Later, the Catholic Church identified a baptism of desire , by which those preparing for baptism who die before actually receiving the sacrament are considered saved. As evidenced also in the common Christian practice of infant baptism , baptism was universally seen by Christians as in some sense necessary for salvation , until Huldrych Zwingli in the 16th century denied its necessity. Today, some Christians, particularly Quakers and the Salvation Army , do not see baptism as necessary, and do not practice the rite. Among those that do, differences can be found in the manner and mode of baptizing and in the understanding of the significance of the rite. Most Christians baptize ""in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit "" (following the Great Commission ), but some baptize in Jesus' name only . Most Christians baptize infants ; many others hold that only believer’s baptism is true baptism. Some insist on submersion or at least partial immersion of the person who is baptized, others consider that any form of washing by water, as long as the water flows on the head, is sufficient. The term ""baptism"" has also been used to refer to any ceremony, trial, or experience by which a person is initiated, purified, or given a name—see Other initiation ceremonies .","Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα baptisma; itself derived from βαπτισμός baptismos, washing) is a Christian rite of admission (or adoption ), almost invariably with the use of water, into the Christian Church generally and also a particular church tradition."

It is thought that much of the plate initially went under North America (particularly the western United States and southwest Canada) at a very shallow angle, creating much of the mountainous terrain in the area (particularly the southern Rocky Mountains ). Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus, from the ""pertaining to building"") is a scientific theory that describes the large-scale motions of Earth 's lithosphere . The model builds on the concepts of continental drift , developed during the first decades of the 20th century. It was accepted by the geoscientific community after the concepts of seafloor spreading were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates . On Earth, there are seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates. Where plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent , divergent , or transform . Earthquakes , volcanic activity , mountain -building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The lateral relative movement of the plates typically varies from zero to 100 mm annually. Tectonic plates are composed of oceanic lithosphere and thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust . Along convergent boundaries, subduction carries plates into the mantle ; the material lost is roughly balanced by the formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading. In this way, the total surface of the globe remains the same. This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt principle. Earlier theories (that still have some supporters) proposed gradual shrinking (contraction) or gradual expansion of the globe. Tectonic plates are able to move because the Earth's lithosphere has a higher strength and lower density than the underlying asthenosphere . Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection . Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from the spreading ridge (due to variations in topography and density of the crust, which result in differences in gravitational forces ) and drag , downward suction , at the subduction zones. Another explanation lies in the different forces generated by the rotation of the globe and the tidal forces of the Sun and the Moon . The relative importance of each of these factors is unclear, and is still subject to debate (see also below).","On Earth, there are seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates."

93,Q1233,what is a popular people meter,popular people meter,People meter,"A people meter is an audience measurement tool used to measure the viewing habits of TV and cable audiences. The People Meter is a 'box', about the size of a paperback book. The box is hooked up to each television set and is accompanied by a remote control unit. Each family member in a sample household is assigned a personal 'viewing button'. It identifies each household member's age and sex. If the TV is turned on and the viewer doesn't identify themselves, the meter flashes to remind them. Additional buttons on the People Meter enable guests to participate in the sample by recording their age, sex and viewing status into the system. The device, known as a 'frequency-based meter', was invented by a British company called Audits of Great Britain (AGB). The successor company to AGB is TNS , which is active in 34 countries around the globe. Originally, these meters identified the frequency of the channels - VHF or UHF - watched on the viewer's TV set. This system became obsolete when Direct to Home ( DTH ) satellite dish became popular and viewers started to get their own satellite decoders. In addition, this system doesn't measure digital broadcasts. Before the People Meter advances, Nielsen used the diary method, which consisted of viewers physically recording the shows they watched. However, there were setbacks with the system. Lower-rated stations claimed the diary method was inaccurate and biased. They argued that because they had lower ratings, those who depended on memory for the diary method the may only remember to track their favorite shows. Stations also argued that if it wasn’t low ratings that skewed the diary method, it might also be the new variety of channels for viewers to choose from. Viewers may not be able to record everything they watch and there is no way of discovering the truth. Finally in 1986, Nielsen developed an electronic meter, People Meter, to solve the problem. The People Meter is an electronic method of television measurement that moved from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored. The meter also recorded real time simultaneously viewing, reducing memory bias. Because Audits of Great Britain (AGB) had just entered the U.S. market executing similar technology, Nielsen felt the need to compete. Nielson made a substantial technological advance before network-era norms entered crisis with transition to the national People Meter sample in 1987. Although People Meters presented substantial improvements over the previous system, the alteration in audience measurement caused significant controversy. The method change costs stations whose audience had been overestimated.The end of the multi-channel transition was in large part due to the continuous changes in technology and distribution. Nielsen was at a disadvantage as their measuring techniques required burdensome adjustments. Luckily for Nielsen, the advances in advertising strategies, distribution windows, and ways people were using television made industry sectors interested in data about viewing behavior. Along with changing their counting methods, Nielsen also started emphasizing their sample in 2003 in reaction to census shifts and requests from some industry sectors. Nielsen’s automated Local People Meter (LPM) technology was introduced in New York and Los Angeles. The LPM improved the method of measurement from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored.",A people meter is an audience measurement tool used to measure the viewing habits of TV and cable audiences.

96,Q1275,WHAT ARE HERITABLE TRAITS,heritable traits,Heritability,"Heritability asks how much genetics are playing a role in differences in height between people. This is not the same as asking how much genetics influences height in any one person.The. heritability of a trait within a population is the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals within a population that is due to genetic differences. Factors including genetics , environment and random chance can all contribute to the variation between individuals in their observable characteristics (in their "" phenotypes ""). Heritability thus analyzes the relative contributions of differences in genetic and non-genetic factors to the total phenotypic variance in a population. For instance, some humans in a population are taller than others; heritability attempts to identify how much genetics are playing a role in part of the population being extra tall. Heritability is measured by estimating the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic differences to the total phenotypic variation in a population. Heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics , particularly in selective breeding and behaviour genetics (for instance twin studies ), but is less widely used in population genetics . Heritability measures the fraction of phenotype variability that can be attributed to genetic variation. This is not the same as saying that this fraction of an individual phenotype is caused by genetics. In addition, heritability can change without any genetic change occurring (e.g. when the environment starts contributing to more variation). A case in point, consider that both genes and environment have the potential to influence intelligence. Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases, causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation (e.g. to show different levels of intelligence). On the other hand, heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases, causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation (e.g. to show more similar levels of intelligence). Heritability is increasing because genetics are contributing more variation, or because non-genetic factors are contributing less variation; what matters is the relative contribution. Here we see why heritability is specific to a particular population in a particular environment. The extent of dependence of phenotype on environment can also be a function of the genes involved. Matters of heritability are complicated because genes may canalize a phenotype, making its expression almost inevitable in all occurring environments. Individuals with the same genotype can also exhibit different phenotypes through a mechanism called phenotypic plasticity , which makes heritability difficult to measure in some cases. Recent insights in molecular biology have identified changes in transcriptional activity of individual genes associated with environmental changes. However, there are a large number of genes whose transcription is not affected by the environment.",heritability of a trait within a population is the proportion of observable differences in a trait between individuals within a population that is due to genetic differences.

Christianity in Africa began in Egypt in the middle of the 1st century. By the end of the 2nd century it had reached the region around Carthage . Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity include Tertullian , Clement of Alexandria , Origen of Alexandria , Cyprian , Athanasius and Augustine of Hippo . The spread of Islam into North Africa reduced the size of Christian congregations as well as their number, so that of the original Churches, only the Coptic Church in Egypt, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Church in the Horn of Africa remain. Both the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Churches profess their own distinctive customs, a unique canon of the Bible and a distinctive architectures. Both these community of Christians in sub-Saharan Africa which is not the product of European missionary work, but can document its foundation prior to any European countries. Christianity is embraced by the majority of the population in most Southern African and Central African states and others in some East and West Africa . The Coptic Christians make up a significant minority in Egypt. The World Book Encyclopedia has estimated that in 2002 Christians formed 40% of the continent's population, with Muslims forming 45%. In a relatively short time, Africa has gone from having a majority of followers of indigenous, traditional religions, to being predominantly a continent of Christians and Muslims . Today in 2013, Traditional African religions is the majority religion only in Togo .

102,Q1345,when does the royal standard fly?,,Royal Standard of the United Kingdom,"The Royal Standard used in England, Northern Ireland, Wales, and overseas. The Royal Standard used in Scotland. For other monarchs' standards, see Royal Standard . The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is the flag used by Elizabeth II in her capacity as Sovereign of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories . Different standards are used in the Queen's other Commonwealth realms , and the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is varied for use in Scotland . Although almost universally called a standard, such flags when used in the United Kingdom are banners of arms , as they comprise the shield of the Royal Arms . Outside the United Kingdom, the Royal Standard is usually a nation's banner of arms with a blue disc containing a wreath of gold roses encircling the crowned letter 'E', (for 'Elizabeth'), superimposed upon it (the Personal Flag of Queen Elizabeth II ). The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is flown when the Queen is in residence in one of the royal residences. It may be flown on any building, official or private, during a visit by the Queen, if the owner or proprietor so requests. The Royal Standard was flown aboard the royal yacht when it was in service and the Queen was on board. The only church that may fly a Royal Standard, even without the presence of the Sovereign, is Westminster Abbey , which is a Royal Peculiar . Other churches generally are not allowed to hoist a Royal Standard. The Royal Standard is flown at royal residences only when the sovereign is present. If the Union Flag is flying above Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle instead of the Royal Standard, the Queen is not in residence. If the ancient Royal Standard of Scotland is flying above Holyrood Palace or Balmoral Castle , instead of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom used in Scotland, it also indicates that the Queen is not in residence. When the Queen attends the Parliament at the Palace of Westminster , the Royal Standard flies from Victoria Tower . Unlike the Union Flag, the usual rule is that the Royal Standard is never flown at half-staff, even after the demise of the Crown , as there is always a sovereign on the throne . Strictly speaking, however, the Royal Standard may be flown at half-staff above a building or on board a boat in which the unburied body of a deceased monarch is lying (as long as the present monarch is not in attendance). When controversy arose regarding the lack of a flag at half-staff over Buckingham Palace following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, a compromise was reached whereby the Union Flag was flown at half-staff. (The Queen was then in summer residence in Balmoral; previously, no flag had flown over Buckingham Palace when the monarch was not present. Since then, the Union Flag has been flown in the Queen's absence .). However the Union Flag can be lowered to fly at half-staff over Buckingham Palace, in times of national mourning (for example after the death of the Queen Mother , the September 11 attacks and the 7 July 2005 London bombings . The Union Flag was also flown at half-staff over Buckingham Palace as a mark of respect on the first anniversary of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on Bank Holiday Monday 31 August 1998).",The Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is flown when the Queen is in residence in one of the royal residences.

105,Q1389,what are the parts of plant stems?,,Plant stem,"Stem showing internode and nodes plus leaf petioles. A stem is one of two main structural axes of a vascular plant . The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes, the nodes hold buds which grow into one or more leaves , inflorescence (flowers), conifer cones , roots , other stems etc. The internodes distance one node from another. The term shoots is often confused with stems; shoots generally refer to new fresh plant growth and does include stems but also to other structures like leaves or flowers. The other main structural axis of plants is the root . In most plants stems are located above the soil surface but some plants have underground stems . A stem develops buds and shoots and usually grows above the ground. Inside the stem, materials move up and down the tissues of the transport system. Stems have four main functions which are:. Support for and the elevation of leaves, flowers and fruits . The stems keep the leaves in the light and provide a place for the plant to keep its flowers and fruits. Transport of fluids between the roots and the shoots in the xylem and phloem . Storage of nutrients. The production of new living tissue. The normal life span of plant cells is one to three years.

Much of the series centers on the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series' popularity has prompted the release of a media franchise , contributing to its position as Nickelodeon 's highest rated show, the most distributed property of MTV Networks , and among Nicktoons' most watched shows. It is listed 15th in IGN's top 100 animated series list. When Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants. He teamed up with several Nickelodeon veterans and Rocko crew members, including creative director Derek Drymon ( Action League Now! , Hey Arnold! , and Rocko's Modern Life) writers and directors Sherm Cohen , and Dan Povenmire , writer Tim Hill , actor and writer Martin Olson , animation director Alan Smart (all from Rocko's Modern Life), and story editor Merriwether Williams ( The Angry Beavers ), who worked on the series for its first few seasons and switched to SpongeBob SquarePants in July 1999. To voice the character of SpongeBob, Hillenburg approached Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on Rocko's Modern Life. ""Steve described SpongeBob to me as childlike and naïve,"" Kenny said in an interview. ""He’s not quite an adult, he’s not quite a kid. Think a Stan Laurel, Jerry Lewis kind of child-man. Kind of like a Munchkin but not quite, kind of like a kid, but not in a Charlie Brown child’s voice on the TV shows."".

The Nickelodeon legal department discovered that the name was already in use for a mop product. Upon finding this out, Hillenburg decided that the character's given name still had to contain ""Sponge"" so viewers would not mistake the character for a ""Cheese Man"". Hillenburg decided to use the name ""SpongeBob"". He chose ""SquarePants"" as a family name as it referred to the character's square shape and it had a ""nice ring to it"".

112,Q1465,when did qing dynasty begin,,Qing Dynasty,"The Qing Dynasty, also Empire of the Great Qing or Great Qing, was the last imperial dynasty of China , ruling from 1644 to 1912 with a brief, abortive restoration in 1917. It was preceded by the Ming Dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China . The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in contemporary Northeastern China . The Aisin Gioro leader, Nurhachi , who was originally a vassal of the Ming emperors , began unifying the Jurchen clans in the late sixteenth century. By 1635, Nurhachi's son Hong Taiji could claim they constituted a single and united Manchu people and began forcing the Ming out of Liaoning in southern Manchuria . In 1644, the Ming capital Beijing was sacked by a peasant revolt led by Li Zicheng , a former minor Ming official who became the leader of the peasant revolt, who then proclaimed the Shun dynasty . The last Ming ruler, the Chongzhen Emperor , committed suicide when the city fell. When Li Zicheng moved against Ming general Wu Sangui , the latter made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Manchurian army. Under Prince Dorgon , they seized control of Beijing and overthrew Li Zicheng's short-lived Shun Dynasty . Complete pacification of China was accomplished around 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor . Over the course of its reign, the Qing became highly integrated with Chinese culture . The imperial examinations continued and Han civil servants administered the empire alongside Manchu ones. The Qing reached its height under the Qianlong Emperor in the eighteenth century, expanding beyond China's prior and later boundaries. Imperial corruption exemplified by the minister Heshen and a series of rebellions, natural disasters, and defeats in wars against European powers gravely weakened the Qing during the nineteenth century. "" Unequal Treaties "" provided for extraterritoriality and removed large areas of treaty ports from Chinese sovereignty. The government attempts to modernize during the Self-Strengthening Movement in the late 19th century yielded few lasting results. Losing the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 was a watershed for the Qing government and the result demonstrated that reform had modernized Japan significantly since the Meiji Restoration in 1867, especially as compared with the Self-Strengthening Movement in China. The 1911 Wuchang Uprising of the New Army ended with the overthrow of the Empress Dowager Longyu and the infant Puyi on February 12, 1912. Despite the declaration of the Republic of China , the generals would continue to fight amongst themselves for the next several decades during the Warlord Era . Aisin-Gioro Puyi was briefly restored to power in Beijing by Zhang Xun in July 1917, and in Manchukuo by the Japanese between 1932 and 1945.","The Qing Dynasty, also Empire of the Great Qing or Great Qing, was the last imperial dynasty of China , ruling from 1644 to 1912 with a brief, abortive restoration in 1917."

114,Q1478,when did texas become a state,,Texas,"Texas is the second most populous and the second-largest of the 50 states in the United States of America , and the largest state in the 48 contiguous United States . Geographically located in the South Central part of the country, Texas shares an international border with the Mexican states of Chihuahua , Coahuila , Nuevo León and Tamaulipas to the south, and borders the U.S. states of New Mexico to the west, Oklahoma to the north, Arkansas to the northeast and Louisiana to the east. Texas has an area of , and a growing population of 26.1 million residents. Houston is the largest city in Texas and the fourth-largest in the United States, while San Antonio is the second largest in the state and seventh largest in the United States. Dallas–Fort Worth and Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest United States metropolitan areas , respectively. Other major cities include El Paso and Austin —the state capital . Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State to signify Texas as a former independent republic and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The ""Lone Star"" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal today. Due to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault , Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the American South and Southwest . Although Texas is popularly associated with the Southwestern deserts , less than 10% of the land area is desert . Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies , grasslands , forests , and the coastline . Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods , to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the Big Bend . The term "" six flags over Texas "" came from the several nations that had ruled over the territory. Spain was the first European country to claim the area of Texas. France held a short-lived colony in Texas. Mexico controlled the territory until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming an independent Republic . In 1845 it joined the United States as the 28th state. The state's annexation set off a chain of events that caused the Mexican–American War in 1846. A slave state , Texas declared its secession from the United States in early 1861, joining the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War . After the war and its restoration to the Union, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation. One Texas industry that thrived after the Civil War was cattle . Due to its long history as a center of the industry, Texas is associated with the image of the cowboy . The state's economic fortunes changed in the early 20th century, when oil discoveries initiated an economic boom in the state. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2010 it shares the top of the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with California at 57. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals , energy , computers and electronics , aerospace , and biomedical sciences . Texas has led the nation in export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross state product .",In 1845 it joined the United States as the 28th state.
115,Q1485,who made the matrix,,The Matrix,"The Matrix is a 1999 American–Australian science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers and starring Keanu Reeves , Laurence Fishburne , Carrie-Anne Moss , Joe Pantoliano , and Hugo Weaving . It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer "" Neo "" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"". The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as "" bullet time "", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre. It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Jean Baudrillard 's Simulacra and Simulation and Lewis Carroll 's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland . The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films , and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions. The Matrix was first released in the United States on , 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was generally well-received by critics, and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards . Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment. The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise. Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films , and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowskis, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions . The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved.","The Matrix is a 1999 American–Australian science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers and starring Keanu Reeves , Laurence Fishburne , Carrie-Anne Moss , Joe Pantoliano , and Hugo Weaving ."
116,Q1486,what are some six sigma tools used,,Six sigma,"The often-used Six Sigma symbol. Six Sigma is a set of tools and strategies for process improvement originally developed by Motorola in 1985. Six Sigma became well known after Jack Welch made it a central focus of his business strategy at General Electric in 1995, and today it is used in different sectors of industry. Six Sigma seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects (errors) and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes . It uses a set of quality management methods, including statistical methods , and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization (""Champions"", ""Black Belts"", ""Green Belts"", ""Orange Belts"", etc.) who are experts in these very complex methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has quantified value targets, for example; process cycle time reduction, customer satisfaction, reduction in pollution, cost reduction and/or profit increase. The term Six Sigma originated from terminology associated with manufacturing, specifically terms associated with statistical modeling of manufacturing processes . The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a sigma rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of the products manufactured are statistically expected to be free of defects (3.4 defects per million), although, as discussed below , this defect level corresponds to only a 4.5 sigma level. Motorola set a goal of ""six sigma"" for all of its manufacturing operations, and this goal became a byword for the management and engineering practices used to achieve it.","It uses a set of quality management methods, including statistical methods , and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization (""Champions"", ""Black Belts"", ""Green Belts"", ""Orange Belts"", etc.) who are experts in these very complex methods."

120,Q1516,when did ww1 end?,,World War I,"World War I (WWI) was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918. It was predominantly called the World War or the Great War from its occurrence until the start of World War II in 1939, and the First World War or World War I thereafter. It involved all the world's great powers , which were assembled in two opposing alliances: the Allies (based on the Triple Entente of the United Kingdom , France and Russia ) and the Central Powers (originally the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy ; but, as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement, Italy did not enter into the war). These alliances were both reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war: Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, and the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria the Central Powers. Ultimately, more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. More than 9 million combatants were killed , largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility. It was the fifth- deadliest conflict in world history, subsequently paving the way for various political changes, such as revolutions in many of the nations involved. One of the long-term causes of the war was the resurgence of imperialism in the foreign policies of the great powers of Europe. More immediately, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria , the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, on 28 June 1914 by Yugoslav nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo triggered a diplomatic crisis when Austria-Hungary subsequently delivered an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia . Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked. Within weeks, the major powers were at war and, via their colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world. On 28 July, the Austro-Hungarians fired the first shots of the war as preparation for the invasion of Serbia . While the Russians mobilised, the Germans invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg on the way to France, providing a casus belli for Britain's declaration of war against Germany. After the German march on Paris was brought to a halt—the so-called Miracle of the Marne —the Western Front settled into a static battle of attrition with a trench line that changed little until 1917. On the Eastern Front , the Russian army was successful against the Austro-Hungarians, but was stopped in its invasion of East Prussia by the Germans. In November the Ottoman Empire joined the war, opening up fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and the Sinai. Italy and Bulgaria went to war in 1915 and Romania in 1916. In Russia, the tsar's government collapsed in March 1917 and a subsequent revolution in November brought the Russians to terms with the Central Powers. After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove back the Germans in a series of successful offensives and American forces began entering the trenches. Germany, which had its own trouble with revolutionaries , agreed to an armistice on 11 November 1918. The war ended in victory for the Allies. Events on the home fronts were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts, as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a total war . By the end of the war, four major imperial powers—the German , Russian , Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires—ceased to exist. The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely. The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states. The League of Nations was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict. The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires, the repercussions of Germany's defeat and problems with the Treaty of Versailles are agreed to be factors contributing to World War II .",World War I (WWI) was a global war centred in Europe that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918.

130,Q1619,what year was President kennedy president?,,John F.

After military service as commander of the Motor Torpedo Boats PT-109 and PT-59 during World War II in the South Pacific , Kennedy represented Massachusetts' 11th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953 as a Democrat . Thereafter, he served in the U.S. Senate from 1953 until 1960. Kennedy defeated Vice President and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. presidential election . At 43 years of age, he is the youngest to have been elected to the office, the second-youngest President (after Theodore Roosevelt ), and the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president. A Catholic , Kennedy is the only non- Protestant president, and is the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize . Events during his presidency included the Bay of Pigs Invasion , the Cuban Missile Crisis , the building of the Berlin Wall , the Space Race , the African-American Civil Rights Movement , and early stages of the Vietnam War . Therein, Kennedy increased the number of military advisers, special operation forces, and helicopters in an effort to curb the spread of communism in South East Asia. The Kennedy administration adopted the policy of the Strategic Hamlet Program which was implemented by the South Vietnamese government. It involved certain forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese from the northern and southern communist insurgents. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963 in Dallas , Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later, before a trial could take place.

However, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that those investigations were flawed and that Kennedy was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy . However, ABC News in their investigation, The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy, confirmed the findings of the Warren Commission; having concluded Oswald acted alone. Kennedy's controversial Department of Defense TFX fighter bomber program led to a Congressional investigation that lasted from 1963 to 1970. Since the 1960s information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light. Details of Kennedy's health problems in which he struggled have become better known, especially since the 1990s.

131,Q1633,what is a monarch to a monarchy,,Monarchy,"A monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually or nominally embodied in a single individual (the monarch ). King Solomon 's royal court. Forms of monarchy differ widely based on the level of legal autonomy the monarch holds in governance, the method of selection of the monarch, and any predetermined limits on the length of their tenure. When the monarch has no or few legal restraints in state and political matters, it is called an absolute monarchy and is a form of autocracy . Cases in which the monarch's discretion is formally limited (most common today) are called constitutional monarchies . In hereditary monarchies , the office is passed through inheritance within a family group, whereas elective monarchies are selected by some system of voting. Historically these systems are most commonly combined, either formally or informally, in some manner. (For instance, in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are considered eligible, whereas many hereditary monarchies have legal requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors that act both as de facto elections and to create situations of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election.). Finally, there are situations in which the expiration of a monarch’s reign is set based either on the calendar or on the achievement of certain goals (repulse of invasion, for instance.). The effect of historical and geographic difference along each of these three axes is to create widely divergent structures and traditions defining “monarchy.”. King Leopold I , an elected founder of the hereditary monarchy of Belgium . Monarchy was the most common form of government into the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent, at least at the national level. Where it exists, it now often takes the form of constitutional monarchy , in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no political power pursuant to a constitution or tradition which allocates governing authority elsewhere. Currently, 44 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 16 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognize Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City , but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia and Morocco ""reign, but do not rule"" although there is considerable variation in the amount of authority they wield. Although they reign under constitutions, the monarchs of Brunei , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and Swaziland appear to continue to exercise more political influence than any other single source of authority in their nations, either by constitutional mandate or by tradition.",A monarchy is a form of government in which sovereignty is actually or nominally embodied in a single individual (the monarch ).

133,Q1662,who designed the statue of liberty,,Statue of Liberty,"The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor , designed by Frédéric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886. The statue, a gift to the United States from the people of France, is of a robed female figure representing Libertas , the Roman goddess of freedom, who bears a torch and a tabula ansata (a tablet evoking the law) upon which is inscribed the date of the American Declaration of Independence , July 4, 1776. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue is an icon of freedom and of the United States: a welcoming signal to immigrants arriving from abroad. Bartholdi was inspired by French law professor and politician Édouard René de Laboulaye , who commented in 1865 that any monument raised to American independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Due to the troubled political situation in France , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the Americans provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions. The torch-bearing arm displayed at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and in New York's Madison Square Park from 1876 to 1882. Fundraising proved difficult, especially for the Americans, and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened due to lack of funds. Publisher Joseph Pulitzer of the World started a drive for donations to complete the project that attracted more than 120,000 contributors, most of whom gave less than a dollar. The statue was constructed in France, shipped overseas in crates, and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe's Island. The statue's completion was marked by New York's first ticker-tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland . The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War ; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service . The statue was closed for renovation for much of 1938. In the early 1980s, it was found to have deteriorated to such an extent that a major restoration was required. While the statue was closed from 1984 to 1986, the torch and a large part of the internal structure were replaced. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, it was closed for reasons of safety and security; the pedestal reopened in 2004 and the statue in 2009, with limits on the number of visitors allowed to ascend to the crown. The statue, including the pedestal and base, was closed for a year until October 28, 2012, so that a secondary staircase and other safety features could be installed; Liberty Island remained open. However, one day after the reopening, Liberty Island closed due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy , and the island remains off limits to the public. Public access to the balcony surrounding the torch has been barred for safety reasons since 1916. The statue will reopen to the public by July 4, 2013.","The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté éclairant le monde) is a neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor , designed by Frédéric Bartholdi and dedicated on October 28, 1886."

135,Q1675,who first synthesized heroin,,Heroin,"Heroin (diacetylmorphine or morphine diacetate ( INN )), also known as diamorphine ( BAN ), and colloquially as H, smack, horse, brown, black, tar, and other names, is an opioid analgesic synthesized by C.R. Alder Wright in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule morphine , found in the opium poppy . It is the 3,6- diacetyl ester of morphine, and functions as a morphine prodrug , meaning that it is metabolically converted to morphine inside the body in order for it to work. When used in medicine it is typically used to treat severe pain, such as that resulting from a heart attack or a severe injury. The name ""heroin"" is only used when being discussed in its illegal form. When it is used in a medical environment, it is referred to as diamorphine. The white crystalline form considered ""pure heroin"" is usually the hydrochloride salt, diacetylmorphine hydrochloride. Illicit heroin is usually in freebase form, dulling the sheen and consistency to a matte-white powder. Because of its lower boiling point , the freebase form of heroin is also smokable. It is prevalent in heroin coming from Afghanistan , which as of 2004 produced roughly 87% of the world supply in illicit raw opium . However, production in Mexico has risen six times from 2007 to 2011, changing that percentage and placing Mexico as the second largest opium producer in the world. Mexican cartels are also known to produce a third type of illicit heroin, commonly called black tar , which results from a simplified, quicker synthesis procedure and contains a high percentage of morphine derivates other than heroin, such as 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). As with other opioids , diacetylmorphine is used as both an analgesic and a recreational drug . Frequent and regular administration is associated with tolerance and physical dependence . Internationally, diacetylmorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs . It is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell diacetylmorphine without a license in almost every country. Under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine, heroin is a legally prescribed controlled drug in the United Kingdom, and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as morphine is, often being preferred over morphine due to its lower side-effect profile. It is also available for prescription to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark, alongside psycho-social care —in the same manner that methadone or buprenorphine are used in the United States or Canada—and a similar programme is being campaigned for by liberal political parties in Norway.","Heroin (diacetylmorphine or morphine diacetate ( INN )), also known as diamorphine ( BAN ), and colloquially as H, smack, horse, brown, black, tar, and other names, is an opioid analgesic synthesized by C.R.

136,Q1689,what type of land is savannah,,Savanna,"Typical tropical savanna in Northern Australia demonstrating the high tree density and regular spacing characteristic of many savannas. A savanna, or savannah, is a grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses. Some classification systems also recognize a grassland savanna from which trees are absent. This article deals only with savanna under the common definition of a grassy woodland with a significant woody plant component. It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced, scattered trees. However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forest. Savannas are also characterized by seasonal water availability, with the majority of rainfall confined to one season. Savannas are associated with several types of biomes . Savannas are frequently in a transitional zone between forest and desert or grassland . Savanna covers approximately 20% of the Earth's land area.","A savanna, or savannah, is a grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close."

138,Q1707,what type of ecosystem does stingrays live in,,Stingray,"Stingrays are a group of rays , which are cartilaginous fishes related to sharks . They are classified in the suborder Myliobatoidei of the order Myliobatiformes , and consist of eight families: Hexatrygonidae (sixgill stingray), Plesiobatidae (deep water stingray), Urolophidae (stingarees), Urotrygonidae (round rays), Dasyatidae (whiptail stingrays), Potamotrygonidae (river stingrays), Gymnuridae (butterfly rays), and Myliobatidae (eagle rays). Most stingrays have one or more barbed stings (modified from dermal denticles ) on the tail, which are used exclusively in self-defense. The stinger may reach a length of approximately , and its underside has two grooves with venom glands . The stinger is covered with a thin layer of skin, the integumentary sheath, in which the venom is concentrated. A few members of the suborder, such as the manta rays and the porcupine ray , do not have stingers. Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world, and also includes species found in warmer temperate oceans, such as Dasyatis thetidis , and those found in the deep ocean , such as Plesiobatis daviesi . The river stingrays , and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray ), are restricted to fresh water . Most myliobatoids are demersal , but some, such as the pelagic stingray and the eagle rays , are pelagic . While most stingrays are relatively widespread and not currently threatened , for several species (for example Taeniura meyeni , D. colarensis , D. garouaensis , and D. laosensis), the conservation status is more problematic, leading to them being listed as vulnerable or endangered by IUCN . The status of several other species are poorly known, leading to them being listed as Data Deficient .","Stingrays are common in coastal tropical and subtropical marine waters throughout the world, and also includes species found in warmer temperate oceans, such as Dasyatis thetidis , and those found in the deep ocean , such as Plesiobatis daviesi ."

140,Q1714,when did marlins start,,Miami Marlins,"The Miami Marlins are a professional baseball team based in Miami , Florida and a member of the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball (MLB's) National League . Their home park is Marlins Park . The Miami Marlins began play in the 1993 season as the Florida Marlins. They played home games from their inaugural season to the 2011 season at Sun Life Stadium , which they shared with the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) and which was also called Joe Robbie Stadium, Pro Player Park, Pro Player Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, and Land Shark Stadium during their tenancy. Beginning with the 2012 Major League Baseball season , they play at Marlins Park in downtown Miami, on the site of the former Orange Bowl . The new park, unlike Sun Life Stadium (which was criticized in its baseball configuration for poor sight lines in some locations), was designed foremost as a baseball park. The new park's name is a temporary one until naming rights are purchased. Per agreement with the city and Miami-Dade County (which owns the park), the Marlins officially changed their name to the ""Miami Marlins"" on November 11, 2011. They also adopted a new logo, color scheme, and uniforms. The Marlins have the distinction of winning a World Series championship every year they qualified for the postseason , doing so in 1997 and 2003 — both times as the National League wild card team. They defeated the American League champion Cleveland Indians in the 1997 series, which was notable for shortstop Edgar Rentería driving in second baseman Craig Counsell for the series-clinching run in the eleventh inning of the seventh and deciding game and the "" fire sale "" which occurred in the off-season following the dramatic win. The 2003 season was notable for the firing of manager Jeff Torborg after thirty-eight games. The Marlins were in last place in the National League East with a 16-22 record at the time.

142,Q1739,when did ms .drgs go into effect,,Diagnosis-related group,"Diagnosis-related group (DRG) is a system to classify hospital cases into one of originally 467 groups. The 467th group was ""Ungroupable"". This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by Robert B Fetter, PhD, of the Yale School of Management, and John D Thompson, MPH, of the Yale School of Public Health. The system is also referred to as ""the DRGs"", and its intent was to identify the ""products"" that a hospital provides. One example of a ""product"" is an appendectomy. The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement, to replace ""cost based"" reimbursement that had been used up to that point. DRGs are assigned by a ""grouper"" program based on ICD (International Classification of Diseases) diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, discharge status, and the presence of complications or comorbidities . DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital for each ""product"", since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources. DRGs may be further grouped into Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs).

143,Q1749,what would be the deliverables,,Deliverable,"Deliverable is a term used in project management to describe a tangible or intangible object produced as a result of the project that is intended to be delivered to a customer (either internal or external). A deliverable could be a report, a document, a server upgrade or any other building block of an overall project. A deliverable may be composed of multiple smaller deliverables. It may be either an outcome to be achieved (as in ""The corporation says that becoming profitable this year is a deliverable."") or an output to be provided (as in ""The deliverable for the completed project consists of a special-purpose electronic device and its controlling software.""). A deliverable differs from a project milestone in that a milestone is a measurement of progress toward an output whereas the deliverable is the result of the process. For a typical project, a milestone might be the completion of a product design while the deliverable might be the technical diagram of the product. A deliverable also differs from a project document in that project document is typically part of a project deliverable, or a project deliverable may contain number of documents and physical things. In technical projects, deliverables can further be classified as hardware , software , or design documents .

The term was coined in 1938 by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner . Kasner popularized the concept in his 1940 book Mathematics and the Imagination . Other names for googol include ten duotrigintillion on the short scale , ten thousand sexdecillion on the long scale , or ten sexdecilliard on the Peletier long scale . A googol has no particular significance in mathematics, but is useful when comparing with other very large quantities such as the number of subatomic particles in the visible universe or the number of hypothetically possible chess games. Edward Kasner used it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and infinity , and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics. A googol is approximately 70! ( factorial of 70). In the binary numeral system , one would need 333 bits to represent a googol, i.e., 1 googol ≈ 2332.19, or exactly . This number is notable for being the subject of the £1 million question in the infamous episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? , when contestant Charles Ingram cheated his way through the show by getting help from his wife Diana, who was in the audience, and fellow contestant Tecwen Whittock.

146,Q1792,What is a 28 day cycle?,,Menstrual cycle,"The menstrual cycle is the scientific term for the physiological changes that occur in fertile women and other female primates for the purposes of sexual reproduction . This article focuses on the human menstrual cycle, a ""monthly"" cycle that can vary around an average of ~28 days per cycle. The menstrual cycle, under the control of the endocrine system , is necessary for reproduction . It is commonly divided into three phases: the follicular phase , ovulation , and the luteal phase . It is also occasionally misclassified using the uterine cycle: menstruation , proliferative phase, and secretory phase. Menstrual cycles are counted from the first day of menstrual bleeding. Hormonal contraception interferes with the normal hormonal changes with the aim of preventing reproduction. Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) slow then stop, and the lining of the uterus thickens. Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles atrophy and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24–36 hours after the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an ovum, or egg in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the egg only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum ; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone . Under the influence of progesterone, the endometrium (uterine lining) changes to prepare for potential implantation of an embryo to establish a pregnancy . If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing sharp drops in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. These hormone drops cause the uterus to shed its lining and egg in a process termed menstruation. In the menstrual cycle, changes occur in the female reproductive system as well as other systems (which lead to breast tenderness or mood changes, for example). A woman's first menstruation is termed menarche , and occurs typically around age 12-13. The end of a woman's reproductive phase is called the menopause , which commonly occurs somewhere between the ages of 45 and 55.","This article focuses on the human menstrual cycle, a ""monthly"" cycle that can vary around an average of ~28 days per cycle."

150,Q1814,who wrote the song for star wars,,Star Wars music,"The music of Star Wars consists of the scores written for all six Star Wars films by composer John Williams from 1977 to 1983 for the Original Trilogy , and 1999 to 2005 for the Prequel Trilogy . Williams' scores for the double trilogy count among the most widely known and popular contributions to modern film music . Additionally, music for Star Wars: The Clone Wars was written by Kevin Kiner, and further music has been composed for Star Wars video games and works in other media. The scores utilize an eclectic variety of musical styles, many culled from the Late Romantic idiom of Richard Strauss and his contemporaries that itself was incorporated into the Golden Age Hollywood scores of Erich Korngold and Max Steiner . While several obvious nods to Gustav Holst , William Walton and Igor Stravinsky exist in the score to Episode IV , Williams relied less and less on classical references in the latter five scores, incorporating more strains of modernist orchestral writing with each progressive score. The reasons for Williams' tapping of a familiar Romantic idiom are known to involve Lucas' desire to ground the otherwise strange and fantastic setting in well-known, audience-accessible music. Indeed, Lucas maintains much of the trilogy's success relies not on advanced visual effects, but on the simple, direct emotional appeal of its plot, characters and, importantly, music. Star Wars often is credited as heralding the beginning of a revival of grand symphonic scores in the late 1970s. One technique in particular is an influence: Williams's revival of a technique called leitmotif , which is most famously associated with the operas of Richard Wagner and, in film scores, with Steiner. A leitmotif is a phrase or melodic cell that signifies a character, place, plot element, mood, idea, relationship or other specific part of the film. It commonly is used in modern film scoring as a device for mentally anchoring certain parts of a film to the soundtrack. Of chief importance for a leitmotif is that it must be strong enough for a listener to latch onto while being flexible enough to undergo variation and development. A series of concerts which featured Star Wars music, Star Wars: In Concert , took place in 2009 and 2010. First performed in London , it went on to tour across the United States and Canada , last playing at London, Ontario, Canada on July 25, 2010.","The music of Star Wars consists of the scores written for all six Star Wars films by composer John Williams from 1977 to 1983 for the Original Trilogy , and 1999 to 2005 for the Prequel Trilogy ."

154,Q1899,what makes of the united states,,United States,"The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly called the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a federal republic consisting of fifty states and a federal district . The lower forty-eight contiguous states and the federal district of Washington, D.C. are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is west of Canada and east of Russia across the Bering Strait, and the state of Hawaii is in the mid-North Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km2) and with around 315 million people, the United States is the third- or fourth-largest country by total area and the third-largest by both land area and population . It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries . The geography and climate of the U.S. is also extremely diverse, with deserts, plains, forests, and mountains that are home to a wide variety of species. Paleoindians migrated from Asia to what is now the United States mainland around 15,000 years ago. After 1500, Old World diseases introduced by Europeans greatly reduced their populations. European colonization began around 1600 and came mostly from England. The United States emerged from thirteen British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and the American colonies led to the American Revolution . On July 4, 1776, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence , which established the United States of America. The American Revolutionary War , which ended with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain , was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire . The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787; twenty-seven Amendments have since been added to the Constitution. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights , were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms . Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny , the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes , acquiring new territories , and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legalized slavery in the United States. By the end of the nineteenth century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from as a global superpower , the first country with nuclear weapons , and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower. The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated 2012 GDP of $15.6 trillion 19% of global GDP at purchasing-power parity , as of 2011. The per capita GDP of the U.S. was the world's sixth-highest as of 2010, although America's wealth inequality was also ranked highest among OECD countries by the World Bank . The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources, a well-developed infrastructure, and high productivity; and while its economy is considered post-industrial it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The country accounts for 39% of global military spending , and is a leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world, as well as a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.","The United States of America (USA or U.S.A.), commonly called the United States (US or U.S.) or America, is a federal republic consisting of fifty states and a federal district .

155,Q1905,what are circumpolar constellations,,Circumpolar constellation,"In astronomy, the circumpolar constellations are constellations that never set from the viewer's perspective. Considered a very important effect in astronomy, it is different from seasonal constellations . Circumpolar constellations stay in the sky. Because of the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the Sun, we divide the stars and constellations into two groups. Some stars and constellations never rise nor set, and they are called circumpolar. All the rest are divided into seasonal stars and constellations. Which stars and constellations will be circumpolar and which seasonal depends on your latitude. In the northern hemisphere, we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the northern circumpolar sky, while in the southern hemisphere, we will always be able to see stars and constellations in the southern circumpolar sky. The celestial north pole, currently marked by Polaris , always has an azimuth equal to zero. Also, its altitude for a given place is fixed and its value is given by the following formula: A = 90-Ø. All stars with a declination less than A are not circumpolar. They are also visible year round at that location. From the North Pole , all constellations north of the celestial equator , (all fully visible constellations) are circumpolar, and similarly from the South Pole . From the equator , there are no circumpolar constellations. From mid-north latitudes (40–50°N), circumpolar constellations may include Ursa Major , Ursa Minor , Draco , Cepheus , Cassiopeia and the not well known Camelopardalis .","In astronomy, the circumpolar constellations are constellations that never set from the viewer's perspective."
156,Q1918,what states allow same sex marriage,,Same-sex marriage in the United States,"Same-sex marriage is legally recognized in several jurisdictions within the United States. As of May 2013, ten states— Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington —as well as the District of Columbia and three Native American tribes —have legalized same-sex marriage, representing 16.1% of the U.S. population. In addition, California , which briefly granted same-sex marriages in 2008, now recognizes them on a conditional basis. While several jurisdictions have legalized same-sex marriage through court rulings, legislative action, and popular vote , nine states prohibit same-sex marriage by statute and 30 prohibit it in their constitutions . The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), enacted in 1996, prevents the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and allows each state to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages performed in other states. The provision of DOMA forbidding the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages has been found unconstitutional in eight federal courts , including two federal appeals courts . Five of these cases are pending review by the Supreme Court . The movement to obtain marriage rights and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s, but became more prominent in U.S. politics in 1993 when the Hawaii Supreme Court declared the state's prohibition to be unconstitutional in Baehr v. Lewin . During the 21st century, public support for legalizing same-sex marriage has grown considerably, and various national polls conducted since 2011 show that a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage. On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to publicly declare support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. On November 6, 2012, Maine , Maryland , and Washington became the first states to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote.","As of May 2013, ten states— Connecticut , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington —as well as the District of Columbia and three Native American tribes —have legalized same-sex marriage, representing 16.1% of the U.S. population."

158,Q1935,what years was the 18th century,,18th century,"Washington crossing the Delaware, Dec. 25 1776, an iconic event of the American Revolution. Storming of the Bastille, July 14, 1789, an iconic event of the French Revolution. 1700 CE world map. The 18th century lasted from January 1, 1701 to December 31, 1800 in the Gregorian calendar . During the 18th century, the Enlightenment culminated in the French and American revolutions . Philosophy and science increased in prominence. Philosophers dreamed of a brighter age. This dream turned into a reality with the French Revolution, although it was later compromised by excess of the terror of Maximilien Robespierre . At first, the monarchies of Europe embraced Enlightenment ideals, but with the French Revolution they feared losing their power and joined wide coalitions with the counter-revolution . The Ottoman Empire was undergoing a protracted decline, as it failed to keep up with the technological advances in Europe. The Tulip period symbolized a period of peace and reorientation towards European society, after victory against a burgeoning Russian Empire in the Pruth River Campaign . Throughout the century various reforms were introduced with limited success. The 18th century also marked the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as an independent state. The once powerful and vast kingdom, that was once able to conquer Moscow and defeat the great Ottoman armies, collapsed under numerous invasions. Its semi-democratic government system was not efficient enough to rival the neighbouring monarchies of Prussia , Russia and Austria who divided the Commonwealth territories among them, changing the landscape of Central European politics for the next hundred years. Great Britain became a major power worldwide with the defeat of France in the Americas , in the 1760s and the conquest of large parts of India . However, Britain lost much of its North American colonies after the American Revolution , which was actively helped by the French. The industrial revolution started in Britain around 1770s with the production of the improved steam engine . Despite its modest beginnings in the 18th century, it would radically change human society and the environment. Western historians have occasionally defined the 18th century otherwise for the purposes of their work. For example, the ""short"" 18th century may be defined as 1715–1789, denoting the period of time between the death of Louis XIV of France and the start of the French Revolution with an emphasis on directly interconnected events. To historians who expand the century to include larger historical movements, the ""long"" 18th century may run from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the battle of Waterloo in 1815 or even later.","The 18th century lasted from January 1, 1701 to December 31, 1800 in the Gregorian calendar ."
159,Q1937,what year was the eiffel tower made,,Eiffel Tower,"The Eiffel Tower (, ) is an iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris , named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel , whose company designed and built the tower. Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair , it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The tower is the tallest structure in Paris and the most-visited paid monument in the world; 7.1 million people ascended it in 2011. The third level observatory's upper platform is at the highest accessible to public in the European Union and the highest in Europe as long as the platform of the Ostankino Tower , at , remains closed as a result of the fire of August 2000. The tower received its 250 millionth visitor in 2010. The tower stands tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Because of the addition, in 1957, of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building. Not including broadcast antennas , it is the second-tallest structure in France , after the Millau Viaduct . The tower has three levels for visitors. Tickets can be purchased to ascend, by stairs or lift (elevator), to the first and second levels. The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the walk from the first to the second level. The third and highest level is accessible only by lift—stairs do exist but are usually closed to the public. The first and second levels have restaurants. The tower has become the most prominent symbol of both Paris and France, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city.","Erected in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair , it has become both a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world."

161,Q1966,what species is a spider,,Spider,"Spiders ( order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom . They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other groups of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica , and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exception of air and sea colonization. As of 2008, at least 43,678 spider species , and 109 families have been recorded by taxonomists ; however, there has been confusion within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900. Anatomically, spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen , and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel . Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae . In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure. Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used. It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-web spiders . Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets. True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving order , the Mesothelae . The main groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae , first appeared in the Triassic period, before . A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi , was described in 2008, but all other known species are predators , mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas , mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they liquidize their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps , as they do not have true jaws. Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders , to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity. While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides . Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers.",Spiders ( order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom .
162,Q1983,what is adoration catholic church,,Eucharistic adoration,"The Eucharist displayed in a monstrance , flanked by candles being adored by a kneeling altar server . Eucharistic adoration is a practice in the Roman Catholic Church , and in a few Anglican and Lutheran churches, in which the Blessed Sacrament is exposed and adored by the faithful. Adoration is a sign of devotion to and worship of Jesus Christ , who is believed by Catholics to be present Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity, under the appearance of the consecrated host , in the form of hosts or bread. As a devotion, Eucharistic adoration and meditation are more than merely looking at the Blessed Host, but are believed to be a continuation of what was celebrated in the Eucharist. From a theological perspective, the adoration is a form of latria , based on the tenet of the presence of Christ in the Blessed Host. Christian meditation performed in the presence of the Eucharist outside of Mass is called Eucharistic meditation. It has been practiced by such as Peter Julian Eymard , Jean Vianney and Thérèse of Lisieux . Authors such as the Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida and Blessed Maria Candida of the Eucharist have produced large volumes of text based on their Eucharistic meditations. When the exposure and adoration of the Eucharist is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called Perpetual adoration. In a monastery or convent , it is done by the resident monks or nuns and, in a parish , by volunteer parishioners since the 20th century. In the opening prayer of the Perpetual chapel in St. Peter Basilica Pope John Paul II prayed for a perpetual adoration chapel in every parish in the world. Pope Benedict XVI instituted perpetual adoration for the laity in each of the five sectors of the diocese of Rome.","Eucharistic adoration is a practice in the Roman Catholic Church , and in a few Anglican and Lutheran churches, in which the Blessed Sacrament is exposed and adored by the faithful."

164,Q1992,Where Elephants Live,,Elephant,"Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea . Traditionally, two species are recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although some evidence suggests that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa , and South and Southeast Asia . They are the only surviving proboscideans; extinct species include mammoths and mastodons . The largest living terrestrial animals , male African elephants can reach a height of and weigh . These animals have several distinctive features, including a long proboscis or trunk used for many purposes, particularly for grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which serve as tools for moving objects and digging and as weapons for fighting. The elephant's large ear flaps help to control the temperature of its body. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs. Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs , forests , deserts and marshes . They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance, and predators such as lions , tigers , hyenas and wild dogs usually target only the young elephants (or ""calves""). Females (or ""cows"") tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The latter are led by the oldest cow, known as the matriarch . Elephants have a fission-fusion society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (or ""bulls"") leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth , which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, and sound; elephants use infrasound , and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans . They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind. African elephants are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered . One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade , as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past they were used in war; today, they are often put on display in zoos and circuses . Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature and popular culture .","Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa , and South and Southeast Asia ."

169,Q2058,What Is Range in Math,,Range (mathematics),"is a function from domain X to codomain Y. The smaller oval inside Y is the image of . Sometimes ""range"" refers to the codomain and sometimes to the image. In mathematics , the range of a function refers to either the codomain or the image of the function, depending upon usage. The codomain is a set containing the function's output, whereas the image is only the part of the codomain where the elements are outputs of the function. For example, the function is often described as a function from the real numbers to the real numbers, meaning that the codomain is R, but its image is the set of non-negative real numbers. Some books say that range of this function is its codomain, the set of all real numbers, reflecting that the function is real-valued. These books call the actual output of the function the image. This is the current usage for range in computer science . Other books say that the range is the function's image, the set of non-negative real numbers, reflecting that a number can be the output of this function if and only if it is a non-negative real number. In this case, the larger set containing the range is called the codomain. This usage is more common in modern mathematics.",is a function from domain X to codomain Y.

195,Q2383,what is the fundamental theorem of calculus used for,,Fundamental theorem of calculus,"The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of the derivative of a function with the concept of the integral . The first part of the theorem, sometimes called the first fundamental theorem of calculus, shows that an indefinite integration can be reversed by a differentiation.

The second part, sometimes called the second fundamental theorem of calculus, allows one to compute the definite integral of a function by using any one of its infinitely many antiderivatives . This part of the theorem has invaluable practical applications, because it markedly simplifies the computation of definite integrals . The first published statement and proof of a restricted version of the fundamental theorem was by James Gregory (1638–1675). Isaac Barrow (1630–1677) proved a more generalized version of the theorem while Barrow's student Isaac Newton (1643–1727) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory.

204,Q2498,what is sado masochism,,Sadomasochism,"Sadomasochism is the giving and/or receiving of pleasure—often sexual—from acts involving the infliction or reception of pain or humiliation . A subset of BDSM , practitioners of sadomasochism usually seek out sexual gratification from these acts, but often seek out other forms of pleasure as well. While the terms sadist and masochist specifically refer to one who either enjoys giving pain (sadist), or one who enjoys receiving pain (masochist), many practitioners of sadomasochism describe themselves as at least somewhat of a switch , or someone who can receive pleasure from either inflicting or receiving pain. The acronym S&M is often used for sadomasochism, although practitioners themselves normally drop the & and use the acronym SM or S/M. Sadomasochism is not considered a clinical paraphilia unless such practices lead to clinically significant distress or impairment for a diagnosis. Similarly, sexual sadism within the context of mutual consent should not be mistaken for acts of sexual violence or aggression.",Sadomasochism is the giving and/or receiving of pleasure—often sexual—from acts involving the infliction or reception of pain or humiliation .
205,Q2511,what is the oath of allegiance of the united states,,Oath of Allegiance (United States),"The United States Oath of Allegiance (officially referred to as the ""Oath of Allegiance,"" 8 C.F.R. Part 337 (2008)) is an oath that must be taken by all immigrants who wish to become United States citizens . The first officially recorded Oaths of Allegiance were made on May 30, 1778 at Valley Forge , during the Revolutionary War . Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines state the Oath of Allegiance at a Citizenship ceremony at Camp Liberty , Iraq in 2009. The current oath is as follows:. In some cases, the United States Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) allows the oath to be taken without the clauses regarding the bearing of arms and performance of noncombatant military service. provides that the phrase ""so help me God"" is optional and that the words ‘on oath’ can be substituted with ‘and solemnly affirm’. Also, if the prospective citizen can prove such commitments are in violation with his or her religion , the lines ""that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by law; that I will perform non-combatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by law"" are sometimes omitted. The current exact text of the Oath of Citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch. However, under the Administrative Procedure Act , CIS could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time, so long as the new text reasonably meets the ""five principles"" mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1953. These principles are:. allegiance to the United States Constitution ,. renunciation of allegiance to any foreign country to which the immigrant has had previous allegiances. defense of the Constitution against enemies ""foreign and domestic"". promise to serve in the United States Armed Forces when required by law (either combat or non-combat). promise to perform civilian duties of ""national importance"" when required by law. There has been some controversy about the wording of the oath, parts of which are based on the British Oath of Supremacy which was written in the 16th Century. As a result, some have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing. In the fall of 2003, CIS planned to change the oath of citizenship in time for Citizenship Day (September 17). The proposed oath was as followed:. The introduction of the new oath was scrapped by the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims on April 1, 2004.","The United States Oath of Allegiance (officially referred to as the ""Oath of Allegiance,"" 8 C.F.R.

206,Q2537,what is the la tour de france,,Tour de France,"The Tour de France () is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France , while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase paper sales for the magazine L'Auto ; it is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation . The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except for when it was stopped for the two World Wars . As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI ProTeams , with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite. Along with the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España , the Tour makes up cycling's prestigious, three-week-long Grand Tours . Traditionally, the race is usually held primarily in the month of July. While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same with the appearance of at least two time trials, the passage through the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps , and the finish on the Champs-Élysées . The modern editions of the Tour de France consist of 21 day-long segments (stages) over a 23-day period. All of the stages are timed to the finish; after finishing the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times. The rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race and gets to don the coveted yellow jersey . While the general classification garners the most attention there are other contests held within the Tour: the points classification for the sprinters, the mountains classification for the climbers with general classification hopes, young rider classification for the riders under the age of 26, and the team classification for the fastest teams.

210,Q2637,when was the tacoma bridge collapse?,,Tacoma Narrows Bridge,"The Tacoma Narrows Bridge is a pair of twin suspension bridges that span the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound in Pierce County , Washington . The bridges connects the city of Tacoma with the Kitsap Peninsula and carry State Route 16 (known as Primary State Highway 14 until 1964) over the strait. Historically, the name ""Tacoma Narrows Bridge"" has applied to the original bridge nicknamed ""Galloping Gertie"", which opened in July 1940 but collapsed because of aeroelastic flutter four months later, as well as the replacement of the original bridge which opened in 1950 and still stands today as the westbound lanes of the present-day twin bridge complex. The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened on July 1, 1940. It received its nickname ""Galloping Gertie"" because of the vertical movement of the deck observed by construction workers during windy conditions. The bridge became known for its pitching deck, and collapsed into Puget Sound the morning of November 7, 1940, under high wind conditions. Engineering issues as well as the United States' involvement in World War II postponed plans to replace the bridge for several years; the replacement bridge was opened on October 14, 1950. By 1990, population growth and development on the Kitsap Peninsula caused traffic on the bridge to exceed its design capacity; as a result, in 1998 Washington voters approved a measure to support building a parallel bridge. After a series of protests and court battles, construction began in 2002 and the new bridge opened to carry eastbound traffic on July 15, 2007, while the 1950 bridge was reconfigured to carry westbound traffic. At the time of their construction, both the 1940 and 1950 bridges were the third-longest suspension bridges in the world in terms of main span length, behind the Golden Gate Bridge and George Washington Bridge . The 1950 and 2007 bridges are now the fifth-longest suspension bridge spans in the United States, and the 31st-longest in the world. Tolls were charged on the bridge for the entire four-month service life of the original span, as well as the first 15 years of the 1950 bridge. In 1965, the bridge's construction bonds plus interest were paid off, and the state ceased toll collection on the bridge. Over 40 years later, tolls were reinstated as part of the financing of the twin span, and are presently collected only from vehicles traveling eastbound.","The bridge became known for its pitching deck, and collapsed into Puget Sound the morning of November 7, 1940, under high wind conditions."
211,Q2640,what is brown flax,,Flax,"Flax (also known as common flax or linseed) (binomial name: Linum usitatissimum) is a member of the genus Linum in the family Linaceae . It is a food and fibre crop that is grown in cooler regions of the world. Flax fibres are taken from the stem of the plant and are two to three times as strong as those of cotton. As well, flax fibers are naturally smooth and straight. Europe and North America depended on flax for cloth until the nineteenth century, when cotton overtook flax as the most common plant used for making linen paper. Flax is grown on the Canadian Prairies for linseed oil, which is used as a drying oil in paints and varnish and in products such as linoleum and printing inks. It is native to the region extending from the eastern Mediterranean to India and was probably first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent . Flax was extensively cultivated in ancient Ethiopia and ancient Egypt . A discovery reported in 2009 of spun, dyed, and knotted wild flax fibers in a prehistoric cave in the Republic of Georgia shows that the plant was already in use by humans at the surprisingly early date of 30,000 BC. New Zealand flax is not related to flax but was named after it, as both plants are used to produce fibers.",It is a food and fibre crop that is grown in cooler regions of the world.

219,Q2738,what is the purpose of child support?,,Child support,"In family law and public policy, child support (or child maintenance) is an ongoing, periodic payment made by a parent for the financial benefit of a child following the end of a marriage or other relationship. Child maintenance is paid directly or indirectly by an obligor to an obligee for the care and support of children of a relationship that has been terminated, or in some cases never existed. Often the obligor is a non-custodial parent. The obligee is typically a custodial parent, a caregiver, a guardian, or the state . Depending on the jurisdiction, a custodial parent may pay child support to a non-custodial parent. Typically one has the same duty to pay child support irrespective of sex, so a mother is required to pay support to a father just as a father must pay a mother. Where there is joint custody, the child is considered to have two custodial parents and no non-custodial parents, and a custodial parent with a higher income (obligor) may be required to pay the other custodial parent (obligee). In family law , child support is often arranged as part of a divorce , marital separation , dissolution of marriage , annulment , determination of parentage or dissolution of a civil union and may supplement alimony (spousal support) arrangements. The right to child support and the responsibilities of parents to provide such support have been internationally recognized. The 1992 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , a binding convention signed by every member nation of the United Nations and formally ratified by all but Somalia and the United States, declares that the upbringing and development of children and a standard of living adequate for the children's development is a common responsibility of both parents and a fundamental human right for children, and asserts that the primary responsibility to provide such for the children rests with their parents. Other United Nations documents and decisions related to child support enforcement include the 1956 New York Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance created under the auspices of the United Nations , which was ratified by the vast majority of UN member nations. In addition, the right to child support, as well as specific implementation and enforcement measures, has been recognized by various other international entities, including the Council of Europe , the European Union and the Hague Conference . Within individual countries, examples of legislation pertaining to, and establishing guidelines for, the implementation and collection of child maintenance include the 1975 Family Law Act ( Australia ), the Child Support Act (United Kingdom) and the Maintenance and Affiliation Act (Fiji) Child support in the United States , 45 C.F.R. 302.56 requires each state to establish and publish a Guideline that is presumptively (but rebuttably) correct, and Review the Guideline, at a minimum, every four (4) years. Child support laws and obligations are known to be recognized in a vast majority of world nations, including the majority of countries in Europe, North America and Australasia, as well as many in Africa, Asia and South America.","In family law and public policy, child support (or child maintenance) is an ongoing, periodic payment made by a parent for the financial benefit of a child following the end of a marriage or other relationship."

King also helped to organize the 1963 March on Washington , where he delivered his "" I Have a Dream "" speech. There, he established his reputation as one of the greatest orators in American history. He also established his reputation as a radical, and became an object of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 's COINTELPRO for the rest of his life. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, recorded his extramarital liaisons and reported on them to government officials, and on one occasion, mailed King a threatening anonymous letter that he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide. On October 14, 1964, King received the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolence . In 1965, he and the SCLC helped to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches and the following year, he took the movement north to Chicago .

During that time, she was a member of the board of directors of Wal-Mart Stores and several other corporations. In 1994, as First Lady of the United States, her major initiative, the Clinton health care plan , failed to gain approval from the U.S. Congress.

Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives. Democracy allows eligible citizens to participate equally—either directly or through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws . It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination . The term originates from the Greek (') ""rule of the people"", which was coined from δῆμος (dêmos) ""people"" and κράτος (kratos) ""power"" or ""rule"" in the 5th century BCE to denote the political systems then existing in Greek city-states , notably Athens ; the term is an antonym to (aristocratie) ""rule of an elite"". While theoretically these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically. The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to an elite class of free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents. A democratic government contrasts to forms of government where power is either held by one, as in a monarchy , or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy . Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy, are now ambiguous because contemporary governments have mixed democratic, oligarchic, and monarchic elements. Karl Popper defined democracy in contrast to dictatorship or tyranny, thus focusing on opportunities for the people to control their leaders and to oust them without the need for a revolution . Several variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is direct democracy , in which all eligible citizens have direct and active participation in the decision making of the government. In most modern democracies, the whole body of all eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called representative democracy . The concept of representative democracy arose largely from ideas and institutions that developed during the European Middle Ages , the Age of Enlightenment , and the American and French Revolutions .",Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in the decisions that affect their lives.

226,Q2880,where was martin luther born,,Martin Luther,"Martin Luther (; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German monk , former Catholic priest , professor of theology and seminal figure of a reform movement in sixteenth century Christianity , subsequently known as the Protestant Reformation . He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money. He confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel with his Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor. Luther taught that salvation is not earned by good deeds but received only as a free gift of God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ as redeemer from sin. His theology challenged the authority of the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptized Christians to be a holy priesthood . Those who identify with Luther's teachings are called Lutherans . His translation of the Bible into the vernacular (instead of Latin ) made it more accessible, which had a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language , added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the writing of an English translation, the King James Bible . His hymns influenced the development of singing in churches. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage , allowing Protestant priests to marry. In his later years, in deteriorating health, Luther became increasingly antisemitic , writing that Jewish homes should be destroyed, their synagogues burned, money confiscated and liberty curtailed. These statements have contributed to his controversial status.","Martin Luther (; 10 November 1483 – 18 February 1546) was a German monk , former Catholic priest , professor of theology and seminal figure of a reform movement in sixteenth century Christianity , subsequently known as the Protestant Reformation ."
227,Q2884,"what is the concept of ""wellness"" ?",,Wellness (alternative medicine),"Wellness is generally used to mean a healthy balance of the mind, body and spirit that results in an overall feeling of well-being . It has been used in the context of alternative medicine since Halbert L. Dunn, M.D. , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s. The modern concept of wellness did not, however, become popular until the 1970s. The term has been defined by the Wisconsin-based National Wellness Institute as an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a more successful existence. URL_http This is consistent with a shift in focus away from illness in viewing human health, typical of contexts where the term wellness is used. In other words, wellness is a view of health that emphasizes the state of the entire being and its ongoing development. The phrase can also be seen as an analogue to the medical term "" homeostasis "". Wellness can also be described as ""the constant, conscious pursuit of living life to its fullest potential."". Halbert L. Dunn, M.D. , began using the phrase high level wellness in the 1950s, based on a series of lectures at a Unitarian Universalist Church in Arlington, Virginia, in the United States. Dunn (196, p. 4) defined wellness as ""an integrated method of functioning which is oriented toward maximizing the potential of which the individual is capable. It requires that the individual maintain a continuum of balance and purposeful direction within the environment where he is functioning."". He also stated that ""wellness is a direction in progress toward an ever-higher potential of functioning"" (p. 6). Alternative approaches to wellness are often denoted by the use of two different phrases: health and wellness, and wellness programs. These kinds of wellness programs offer alternative medicine techniques to improve wellness. Whether these techniques actually improve physical health is controversial and a subject of much debate. James Randi and the James Randi Educational Foundation are outspoken critics of this alternative new age concept of wellness. The behaviors in the pursuit of wellness often include many health related practices, such as natural therapies . Wellness, as a luxury pursuit, is found obviously in the more affluent societies because it involves managing the body state after the basic needs of food, shelter and basic medical care have already been met. Many of the practices applied in the pursuit of wellness, in fact, are aimed at controlling the side effects of affluence, such as obesity and inactivity. Wellness grew as a popular concept starting in the 19th century, just as the middle class began emerging in the industrialized world, and a time when a newly prosperous public had the time and the resources to pursue wellness and other forms of self-improvement.","Wellness is generally used to mean a healthy balance of the mind, body and spirit that results in an overall feeling of well-being ."
228,Q2903,what is the measurements of saturn's moons,,Moons of Saturn,"The moons of Saturn (also known as the natural satellites of Saturn) are numerous and diverse ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous Titan which is larger than the planet Mercury . Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers. Saturn has seven moons that are large enough to be ellipsoidal due to having planetary mass , as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own. Particularly notable among Saturn's moons are Titan, the second- largest moon in the Solar System, with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape including hydrocarbon lakes and dry river networks; and Enceladus , which emits jets of gas and dust and may harbor liquid water under its south pole region. Twenty-four of Saturn's moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane. They include the seven major satellites, four small moons which exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons, two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons which act as shepherds of Saturn's F Ring . Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the A Ring , within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn . The remaining 38, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits are much farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde . These moons are probably captured minor planets , or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families . The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit , Norse , and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The largest of the irregular moons is Phoebe , the ninth moon of Saturn, and was discovered at the end of the 19th century. The rings of Saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to hundreds of meters, each of which is on its own orbit about the planet. Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. At least 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.","Saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers."

230,Q2931,what is google openid,,OpenID,"The OpenID logo. OpenID is an open standard that allows users to be authenticated by certain co-operating sites (known as Relying Parties or RP) using a third party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc systems and allowing users to consolidate their digital identities . Users may create accounts with their preferred OpenID identity providers , and then use those accounts as the basis for signing on to any website which accepts OpenID authentication. The OpenID standard provides a framework for the communication that must take place between the identity provider and the OpenID acceptor (the ""relying party""). An extension to the standard (the OpenID Attribute Exchange) facilitates the transfer of user attributes, such as name and gender, from the OpenID identity provider to the relying party (each relying party may request a different set of attributes, depending on its requirements). The OpenID protocol does not rely on a central authority to authenticate a user's identity. Moreover, neither services nor the OpenID standard may mandate a specific means by which to authenticate users, allowing for approaches ranging from the common (such as passwords) to the novel (such as smart cards or biometrics ). The term OpenID may also refer to an identifier as specified in the OpenID standard; these identifiers take the form of a unique URI , and are managed by some 'OpenID provider' that handles authentication. OpenID authentication is now used and provided by several large websites. Providers include Google , Yahoo! , PayPal , BBC , AOL , LiveJournal , MySpace , IBM , Steam , Sherdog , Orange and VeriSign .","OpenID is an open standard that allows users to be authenticated by certain co-operating sites (known as Relying Parties or RP) using a third party service, eliminating the need for webmasters to provide their own ad hoc systems and allowing users to consolidate their digital identities ."
231,Q2933,what is atherosclerotic heart disease,,Atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglyceride . It is a syndrome affecting arterial blood vessels , a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of arteries, caused largely by the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and promoted by low-density lipoproteins (LDL, plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides ) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the macrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (see apoA-1 Milano ). It is commonly referred to as a hardening or furring of the arteries. It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques within the arteries. The atheromatous plaque is divided into three distinct components:. The atheroma (""lump of gruel,"" from ἀθήρα, athera, gruel in Greek), which is the nodular accumulation of a soft, flaky, yellowish material at the center of large plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the lumen of the artery. Underlying areas of cholesterol crystals. Calcification at the outer base of older/more advanced lesions . The following terms are similar, yet distinct, in both spelling and meaning, and can be easily confused: arteriosclerosis , arteriolosclerosis , and atherosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis is a general term describing any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of medium or large arteries (from the Greek arteria , meaning artery, and , meaning hardening); arteriolosclerosis is any hardening (and loss of elasticity) of arterioles (small arteries); atherosclerosis is a hardening of an artery specifically due to an atheromatous plaque. The term atherogenic is used for substances or processes that cause atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that remains asymptomatic for decades. Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques are separated into two broad categories: Stable and unstable (also called vulnerable). The pathobiology of atherosclerotic lesions is very complicated but generally, stable atherosclerotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells , while, unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arterial lumen (also known as the fibrous cap ) is usually weak and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the fibrous cap expose thrombogenic material, such as collagen to the circulation and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen. Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries outright (i.e. coronary occlusion), but more often they detach, move into the circulation and eventually occlude smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism (i.e. Stroke is often caused by thrombus formation in the carotid arteries). Apart from thromboembolism , chronically expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete closure of the lumen. Interestingly, chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient resulting in ischemia . These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable plaque ), causing the formation of a thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately 5 minutes. This catastrophic event is called an infarction . One of the most common recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis of a coronary artery , causing myocardial infarction (a heart attack). The same process in an artery to the brain is commonly called stroke . Another common scenario in very advanced disease is claudication from insufficient blood supply to the legs, typically caused by a combination of both stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots . Atherosclerosis affects the entire artery tree, but mostly larger, high-pressure vessels such as the coronary, renal, femoral, cerebral, and carotid arteries. These are termed "" clinically silent "" because the person having the infarction does not notice the problem and does not seek medical help, or when they do, physicians do not recognize what has happened.","Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic vascular disease or ASVD) is a condition in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the accumulation of fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglyceride .

For the Canadian politician, see Douglas Francis McArthur . For the diplomat, see Douglas MacArthur II . For other uses, see General MacArthur (disambiguation) . General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (26 January 18805 April 1964) was an American general and field marshal of the Philippine Army who was Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign , which made him and his father Arthur MacArthur, Jr. , the first father and son to be awarded the medal. He was one of only five men ever to rise to the rank of General of the Army in the U.S. Army, and the only man ever to become a field marshal in the Philippine Army. Raised in a military family in the American Old West , MacArthur was valedictorian at the West Texas Military Academy , and First Captain at the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated top of the class of 1903. During the 1914 United States occupation of Veracruz , he conducted a reconnaissance mission, for which he was nominated for the Medal of Honor. In 1917, he was promoted from major to colonel and became chief of staff of the 42nd (Rainbow) Division . In the fighting on the Western Front during World War I, he rose to the rank of brigadier general, was again nominated for a Medal of Honor, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross twice and the Silver Star seven times. From 1919 to 1922, MacArthur served as Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, where he attempted a series of reforms. His next assignment was in the Philippines, where in 1924 he was instrumental in quelling the Philippine Scout Mutiny . In 1925, he became the Army's youngest major general. He served on the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell and was president of the American Olympic Committee during the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In 1930, he became Chief of Staff of the United States Army. As such, he was involved in the expulsion of the Bonus Army protesters from Washington, D.C. in 1932, and the establishment and organization of the Civilian Conservation Corps . He retired from the U.S. Army in 1937 to become Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines . MacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East . A series of disasters followed, starting with the destruction of his air forces on 8 December 1941, and the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese. MacArthur's forces were soon compelled to withdraw to Bataan , where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left nearby Corregidor Island in PT boats and escaped to Australia , where MacArthur became Supreme Commander , Southwest Pacific Area . For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines. He officially accepted Japan's surrender on 2 September 1945, and oversaw the occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1951. As the effective ruler of Japan, he oversaw sweeping economic, political and social changes. He led the United Nations Command in the Korean War until he was removed from command by President Harry S. Truman on 11 April 1951. He later became Chairman of the Board of Remington Rand .","He officially accepted Japan's surrender on 2 September 1945, and oversaw the occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1951."
