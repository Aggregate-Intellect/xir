FOR THE \\nFUTURE, THERE IS TALK OF A BOOK, LECTURE TOURS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crowd cheered, Margaret Thatcher raised her hand in a familiar wave and \\nthen she was gone, out the gates of Buckingham Palace and into history. \\n\\n\\nThatcher, prime minister for more than 11 years, had formally resigned and \\nreturned her \"letters patent\" to Queen Elizabeth II and bade the monarch \\nfarewell in a 45-minute audience Wednesday morning. \\n\\n\\nShe had already made her final appearance as prime minister at the House of \\nCommons and said goodby to her staff at 10 Downing St., her office and \\nresidence, and at Conservative Party headquarters. \\n\\n\\nWishing her successor well, she declared in an emotional statement on the steps \\nof 10 Downing: \"It has been a tremendous privilege to serve this country as \\nprime minister. Now, it is time for a new chapter to open, and I wish John \\nMajor all the luck in the world.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd without further ceremony, the Thatcher era ended. \\n\\n\\nWinning three elections in a row, Thatcher had been prime minister longer than \\nany of her predecessors in this century and worked great changes across the \\nwhole of British society. But last week, Conservative members of Parliament, \\nfearing that they would lose the next election under her leadership, forced her \\nresignation. \\n\\n\\n\"Her time had come to an end, and she came to recognize it,\" Norman Tebbit, one \\nof her closest political advisers, commented Tuesday. \"It hurt -- there is no \\ndenying that it hurt her -- but she recognized it and resigned. Now Margaret \\nThatcher is gone, and we have John Major as the leader of our party.\" \\n\\n\\nSenior Cabinet members were speaking Tuesday of the \"natural renewal of the \\nparty,\" but many British political commentators were describing it as a \"palace \\ncoup\" to remove an increasingly unpopular prime minister. \\n\\n\\nBut Thatcher, although described by columnists as \"bitter\" over her ouster, \\nheld her peace, apparently satisfied that Major, who already had become her \\nchoice as a successor, was safely installed as the party\\'s leader and prime \\nminister. \\n\\n\\nThe gossip columnist Nigel Dempster reported that Thatcher had told her \"inner \\ncircle\" at the beginning of November that she would resign next spring after \\nMajor, who had been chancellor of the exchequer, had introduced a new, \\nelection-winning budget, complete with tax cuts and lower interest rates. \\n\\n\\nThatcher \"wished to hand over to Major in the most favorable conditions,\" \\nDempster reported in what appeared to be an attempt to put the best face on \\nwhat had been a great humiliation for her. \\n\\n\\nMajor, she declared as she left Downing Street, \"has the makings of a great \\nprime minister, which I am sure he will become in a very short time.\" \\n\\n\\n\"She has behaved impeccably in a most appalling business,\" Lord St. John of \\nFawsley, another Thatcher supporter, said with admiration, and a British \\nBroadcasting Corp. commentator described her as \"playing the role of a tragic \\nheroine with absolute aplomb.\" \\n\\n\\nSince her resignation last Thursday, Thatcher has acted with such poise, in \\nfact, that it seemed -- except for the brief moment Tuesday morning when she \\nchoked back tears outside Downing Street -- as if she had wanted all this to \\nhappen and had even orchestrated it. \\n\\n\\nBut Thatcher\\'s tenure had ended so abruptly, so unexpectedly -- there is no \\nlame-duck period of transition in British politics -- that her plans for the \\nfuture were far from clear. Although 65, she has no intention of retiring, but \\nwhat she will do after such a long tenure at the top is uncertain. \\n\\n\\n\"I will be in the House (of Commons) tomorrow,\" she told reporters gathered \\noutside her non-official home in the southern London suburb of Dulwich, \\nrecalling that she still represents the London constituency of Finchley in \\nParliament. \"We have always worked. It is the only thing we know.\" \\n\\n\\nAt her final appearance as prime minister -- her 698th \"question time\" in the \\nHouse of Commons -- she had promised that her sharp debate \"will continue from \\nthe back benches as they have from the front.\" \\n\\n\\nFormer British prime ministers, however, are by political custom entitled to a \\nhereditary earldom, and Thatcher has already been proposed by Burke\\'s Peerage, \\nthe company that keeps track of the British nobility, as the \"Countess of \\nGrantham,\" a title that would recall her humble origins as a grocer\\'s daughter \\nin the Lincolnshire village of Grantham. \\n\\n\\nThis would entitle her to sit in the House of Lords, the upper chamber of \\nParliament, and provide her with a forum in which she can speak out regularly. \\n(Her husband, Denis, would remain \"Mr. Thatcher,\" according to Burke\\'s, but her \\nson Mark, a businessman in Texas, would become the Earl of Grantham on her \\ndeath.) \\n\\n\\nThatcher advisers, including Tebbit, said she is likely to defer that honor, if \\nshe does accept it, until the next election rather than cause a by-election in \\nwhich her Finchley seat in Commons might be lost to another party. \\n\\n\\nFor the moment, she has arranged a temporary office at the House of Commons and \\nborrowed staff to answer the more than 30,000 letters she has received, \\narriving by the sackful, since she resigned. So many flowers were received, \\nmore than 1,200 bouquets, that a small fleet of government trucks had to be \\nmobilized to distribute them to London hospitals. \\n\\n\\nHer next priority, according to aides, will be to take up the scores of \\ninvitations for speeches around the world, and she will probably start with a \\ntrip to the United States. \\n\\n\\nAnd later she will probably write her memoirs, which London literary agents say \\ncould fetch as much as $12 million in royalties. \\n\\n\\n\"First, she wants to re-emerge into the world by overcoming the \\'withdrawal \\nsymptoms\\' that come when you give up power,\" her daughter Carol, a free-lance \\njournalist, said over the weekend. \\n\\n\\nFor the longer term, Thatcher is said to be considering the creation of a \\nfoundation, much like the one now headed by former President Jimmy Carter, that \\ncould serve as a base for her as well as a center to propagate Thatcherism, as \\nher conservative philosophy of less government, more individual initiative and \\ngreater self-reliance is now known. \\n\\n\\n\"There is a large world stage for her,\" Tebbit commented, \"and I hope that she \\nwill remain on it for a very long time. . . . There has never been a former \\nprime minister like this one.\" \\n\\n\\nThere have also been some playful proposals for Thatcher -- president of the \\nEuropean Community, succeeding Jacques Delors, whom she has often criticized, \\nand even governor of a European central bank, whose creation she opposes. \\n\\n\\nThatcher\\'s salary as an ordinary member of Parliament is the equivalent of \\n$52,600, a sharp drop from the $131,700 she received as prime minister, but her \\n75-year-old husband, a retired businessman, is a multimillionaire. \\n\\n\\nThe whole transition was summed up symbolically as Thatcher, no longer in the \\nprime minister\\'s black Jaguar but in a lesser bulletproof, bomb-proof \\nlimousine, drove out of Buckingham Palace and headed toward her home in \\nDulwich, a quiet, leafy suburb of stockbrokers, businessmen and professors, \\nrather than back to Downing Street. \\n\\n\\nPurchased four years ago, the new, $800,000, five-bedroom house has never been \\nlived in. Rather, Thatcher kept it for just such a moment, recalling how former \\nPrime Minister Edward Heath had to hunt for a place to live after he was ousted \\nin a 1974 parliamentary election. \\n\\n\\nAll week long, Denis Thatcher, usually wearing an old blue cardigan, had been \\nloading the family car, an equally old Ford station wagon, with suitcases and \\nboxes and driving them down to Dulwich. On Monday, a big white moving van had \\ntaken away the rest of the Thatcher belongings -- so many, in fact, that much \\nof the family furniture and personal effects were put into storage. \\n\\n\\nThe house is protected by an iron gate and high walls on three sides but is \\nopen on the fourth to a golf course, where Denis Thatcher hopes to spend much \\nof his time. The residence will be guarded by the government\\'s diplomatic \\nprotection service. \\n\\n\\nThatcher, still regarded as a target for terrorists, will have police \\nbodyguards, and the government will provide her with an armored limousine. But \\nDenis Thatcher, who had to sell his cherished Rolls-Royce for public relations \\nreasons when his wife became prime minister, plans to buy another. \\n\\n\\nCarol and Mark Thatcher have been helping with the moving, and Carol took on \\nthe task of stocking the Dulwich house with food. \\n\\n\\n\"I offered because I knew she hasn\\'t been to the supermarket for 12 years,\" \\nCarol recalled. \"Then she said, \\'Of course I have been to the supermarket -- I \\nhave opened enough of them.\\' She\\'ll be all right.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n920212\\n\\n\\nFT  12 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher leads passing-out parade\\nof MPs - Ivor Owen on those leaving the Commons at the general election\\n\\n\\neven though the general election is at least eight weeks off. They are the\\n80 politicians who know they are not returning to the Commons, whatever the\\nvoters decide.\\nA former prime minister, three former chancellors and an assortment of\\npanjandrums are among those not seeking re-election at the poll, which is\\nlikely to be on April 9.\\nWhatever the final verdict on the achievements of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, she\\nis certain to be remembered as the first prime minister to vacate 10 Downing\\nStreet after being given notice to quit by disenchanted party colleagues.\\nTwo of the former chancellors - Sir Geoffrey Howe and Mr Nigel Lawson - were\\nclosely associated with Mrs Thatcher's successes in the days when opponents\\nas well as supporters believed she was electorally unstoppable.\\nUntil his resignation speech in November 1990 Sir Geoffrey Howe seemed\\ncontent with the mantle of Sir Austen Chamberlain - the Conservative cabinet\\nminister and leadership contender of an earlier generation - who was said to\\nhave 'always played the game - and always lost it'.\\nSir Geoffrey may have failed in his ambition to emulate his political hero,\\nDavid Lloyd George, by becoming prime minister - but the 19-minute speech in\\nwhich he spelt out the way in which Mrs Thatcher had dispensed with the\\nconcept of cabinet government was the key link in the chain of events that\\nled to her departure from office.\\nIt was just over a year earlier that Mr Lawson resigned as chancellor when\\nhis policy differences with Mrs Thatcher and Sir Alan Walters, her chief\\neconomic adviser, finally became unbridgeable.\\nMr Denis Healey, whose dramatic recall from London Airport to the Treasury\\nin 1976 as the pound tottered left an indelible imprint on his period as\\nchancellor, will be absent from the Labour benches when MPs return after the\\ngeneral election.\\nHe, like the other former chancellors and Mrs Thatcher, seems certain to be\\namong the dozen or so former ministers heading for the red benches of the\\nLords later this year.\\nThey are unlikely to be joined by another prominent politician with a clear\\nclaim to a peerage - Mr Michael Foot, the former Labour leader, who has\\nfrequently called for the abolition of the Lords.\\nMr Foot first entered the Commons in 1945 as MP for Devonport. He will leave\\nparliament at the same time as the current occupant of that constituency, Dr\\nDavid Owen, who led the Social Democratic party into oblivion.\\nIt is generally recognised that Dr Owen's persistent but vain attempts to\\nchange the electoral system and end the dominance of the two main parties\\nseriously aggravated the injuries Labour suffered under Mr Foot's\\nleadership.\\nMrs Thatcher's frequently expressed admiration for Dr Owen reflected her\\njudgment that, whether by accident or design, he made a significant\\ncontribution to the most spectacular of the three successive general\\nelection triumphs secured by the Conservatives under her leadership - the\\nmajority of 144 in 1983.\\nAlso bowing out from the Commons will be Sir Ian Gilmour, whose background\\nof Eton, Balliol and the army - as well as an inherited baronetcy - would,\\nin earlier times, have classified him as the archetypal Tory MP.\\nSir Ian was never taken in by what he saw as the exaggerated claims about\\nthe achievements of Thatcherism. Both before and after his dismissal from\\nthe cabinet in 1981 he warned that the so-called economic miracle -\\nenthusiastically trumpeted by Mr John Major among others - would prove\\nillusory.\\nAnother notable departure from the Conservative ranks will be Mr Michael\\nLatham, who at the politically early age of 49 has decided to vacate Rutland\\nand Melton, which returned him with a 23,022 majority in 1987.\\nMr Latham, an Anglican lay preacher, took up the initially unpaid\\nappointment of executive director of the Council of Christians and Jews at\\nthe start of February.\\nMr Bernard Weatherill, the retiring speaker, had a distinction not shared by\\nany of his predecessors. He presided over the introduction of television\\ncameras to the Commons - and, with the footage becoming popular in the US,\\nhe has become a familiar figure on both sides of the Atlantic.\\nHis successor as speaker will preside over the biggest Commons membership\\nsince the Second World War. The growth in the electorate of Milton Keynes\\nhas entitled the area to an additional constituency - 651 MPs, instead of\\nthe present 650, will be returned at the election.\\nMr Edward Heath, who looked towards Europe in his maiden speech in 1950 and\\nas prime minister took Britain into the European Community in 1973, will be\\nthe 'father' of the new House.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nNovember 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHATCHER STEPS DOWN; THREE VIE FOR HER POST; \\n\\n\\nBRITAIN: THE PRIME MINISTER HAD NEVER LOST AN ELECTION. TORIES WILL CHOOSE A \\nNEW LEADER AS EARLY AS NEXT TUESDAY. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMargaret Thatcher, beset by a challenge from within her own ruling party, \\nstunned Britain on Thursday by resigning as prime minister. \\n\\n\\nThatcher\\'s decision to step down under fire came during a fractious fight for \\nthe Conservative Party leadership -- and only a day after she had vowed in the \\nHouse of Commons: \"I fight on. I fight to win.\" \\n\\n\\nIn the end, her own closest aides convinced her that the challenge mounted by \\nformer Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had left her seriously wounded, and \\nthey warned her that Heseltine could defeat her in the next test for the party \\nleadership. \\n\\n\\nThe feisty, right-wing Thatcher has been prime minister longer than any other \\nBritish leader in this century and has never lost an election. \\n\\n\\nHer decision threw wide open the contest for the leadership of Britain\\'s ruling \\nparty -- and, automatically, the prime minister\\'s post. By the noon Thursday \\ndeadline for entering the race, three prominent Tories -- Heseltine, former \\nDeputy Prime Minister Douglas Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major \\n-- had declared their candidacies. \\n\\n\\nTechnically, Thatcher will remain prime minister and party chief until the \\nTories elect a new leader, who will then become prime minister. That could come \\nas early as next Tuesday, when the party gathers to vote on its leadership. \\n\\n\\nWhen news of her resignation swept through the houses of Parliament Thursday \\nmorning, some of her supporters were seen to be in tears. \\n\\n\\nOne of those, Home Secretary David Waddington, said: \"I have never been sadder \\nin all my life. She was a great leader, and the last thing I wanted was to see \\nher step down in this way.\" \\n\\n\\nBut in the afternoon, Thatcher -- whom some have dubbed \"the Iron Lady\" -- \\ndemonstrated that she was still the head of government, giving a bravura \\nperformance in the House of Commons as she argued against a no-confidence \\nmotion introduced by Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor Party. \\n\\n\\nSpeaking of his motion, Kinnock said, \"There isn\\'t much of a government to have \\nno confidence in.\" \\n\\n\\nBut buoyed by her tough, effective speech defending her government\\'s record, \\nthe Tories roundly defeated the no-confidence measure, 367 to 247. \\n\\n\\nThatcher then summarily rejected a call by Kinnock that new national elections \\nbe called immediately. The next general election must be held before mid-1992, \\nbut the precise timing is up to the prime minister. Thus, considering their \\ncomfortable majority in Parliament, the Conservatives will remain in power for \\nanother 18 months. \\n\\n\\nIn the raucous Commons session, Thatcher seemed relaxed, winning both laughter \\nand applause, even from some of her longtime critics. Wearing her trademark \\nbright blue suit, she castigated the opposition with a vintage performance and \\nat one point declared, \"I\\'m enjoying this.\" \\n\\n\\n\"You can wipe the floor with these people,\" interjected one of her supporters, \\nand Thatcher responded with an elaborate bow. \\n\\n\\nShe was relentless in defending her policies. \"We are no longer the sick man of \\nEurope,\" she declared to the lawmakers. \\n\\n\\nAt one point, after she commented on the notion of a central European bank, \\nwhich she has long opposed, Laborite Dennis Skinner jokingly called out that \\nshe herself could become the bank\\'s governor. \\n\\n\\nShe did a double take, then exclaimed, \"What a good idea!\" \\n\\n\\nThatcher\\'s agonizing decision was prompted by the challenge of former Defense \\nSecretary Heseltine, who ran against her in the first ballot for party leader \\nlast Tuesday and succeeded in forcing her into a runoff. The second round now \\nwill be held without her. \\n\\n\\nAfter Thatcher\\'s resignation, two of her Cabinet colleagues announced their \\ncandidacy for the party leadership: Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, 60, and \\nChancellor of the Exchequer John Major, 47, both viewed as \"stop-Heseltine\" \\nmen. \\n\\n\\nIf none of the three candidates gains a simple majority of the 372 Conservative \\nmembers of the House of Commons on Tuesday, a final election will be held two \\ndays later. \\n\\n\\nThatcher\\'s dramatic announcement came a day after she had participated in the \\n34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which she was \\nthe senior major national leader in attendance. \\n\\n\\nHearing the news, her fellow world leaders expressed their sorrow at the \\nprospect of her leaving the world stage, one on which she played a powerful \\nrole during her three consecutive terms and 11 1/2 years in office. \\n\\n\\nIn all, she spent a total of 4,220 days at 10 Downing St., a time in which \\nBritain\\'s first woman prime minister led the country in the 1982 Falkland \\nIslands War and survived an assassination attempt in 1984 when the Irish \\nRepublican Army bombed the site of a party conference in Brighton. \\n\\n\\nPresident Bush, who counted Thatcher as one of his staunchest allies, said in \\nSaudi Arabia, where he was visiting U.\". troops: \\n\\n\\n\"Margaret Thatcher was an outstanding prime minister and an outstanding ally \\nfor the United States. You always knew where she was and what she believed. \\nI\\'ll miss her.\" \\n\\n\\nA U.\" Marine was overheard telling the President: \"I thought she\\'d duke it \\nout,\" and Bush replied, \"So did I.\" \\n\\n\\nIn Los Angeles, former President Ronald Reagan, who was always grateful for \\nThatcher\\'s support of his conservative stance in foreign affairs, praised her \\n\"bold and visionary policies,\" which he said restored Britain to greatness. \\n\\n\\nIn Baghdad, Iraqi government spokesman Naji Hadithi declared: \"This is most \\nwelcome news. Anyone who replaces her would be better than she was.\" \\n\\n\\nThatcher was notable in her support for Bush\\'s military commitment against Iraq \\nin the Persian Gulf. And, holding true to form, she had Defense Secretary Tom \\nKing announce Thursday that Britain was sending an additional 14,000 troops to \\nthe multinational force in Saudi Arabia. \\n\\n\\nThatcher was the first among Western leaders to welcome the advent of Soviet \\nPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev to prominence. It was the Russians who \\nchristened her \"the Iron Lady.\" \\n\\n\\nShe was first elected leader of the Conservative Party in 1975, deposing \\ndefeated Prime Minister Edward Heath. In 1979, she led the Tories to victory \\nover Labor, then beat the opposition again in 1983 and 1987. She was Britain\\'s \\nfirst prime minister since the 19th Century to win three national elections. \\n\\n\\nOpinion polls showed that the party was generally more popular than she -- due, \\npolitical commentators said, to her often abrasive and authoritive manner, \\nwhich she carried into relations with her Cabinet members. \\n\\n\\nHer decision to push for the so-called poll or head tax as the basic community \\nfund-raising device was widely unpopular. And inflation and mortgages were \\nrecently at a near high for her government. \\n\\n\\nBut the immediate events leading to her downfall began with the summit meeting \\nof the 12-member European Community in Rome late last month, when she found \\nherself, as usual, as the odd leader out -- the lone objector to proposals for \\na common currency. \\n\\n\\nOn her return to London, she gave a reasoned defense of her policy to the House \\nof Commons but then, in the give-and-take of questioning, sounded particularly \\nshrill in her comments against the Common Market. \\n\\n\\nThis upset Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe, whom she had removed from the \\nforeign secretary\\'s post. On Nov. 1, Howe resigned over Thatcher\\'s lack of \\ncommitment to a strong British role in Europe. \\n\\n\\nOn Nov. 13, Howe, who had been regarded as a dedicated Thatcher loyalist, \\nelectrified the House of Commons with a scathing speech giving his reasons for \\nhis resignation. He openly criticized Thatcher and, in the view of many \\nobservers, inflicted irreparable damage to her. \\n\\n\\nThat opened the door for Heseltine, 57, who has long been regarded as the \\nstrongest potential challenger to her leadership and who had resigned from the \\nCabinet as defense secretary in 1986 over his differences with Thatcher. \\n\\n\\nHeseltine announced his candidacy for the leadership, and last Tuesday, while \\nThatcher was at the Paris summit, ran well against her, holding her lead to \\nonly 55%. \\n\\n\\nUnder the party\\'s complicated rules, Thatcher needed a majority plus 15% of the \\nvotes of the 372 Tory members, which she narrowly failed to get, in part \\nbecause of the poor performance attributed to her campaign leaders in the \\ncontest. \\n\\n\\nAt first, the prime minister reacted in typical fashion: In Paris on Tuesday \\nand back in London on Wednesday afternoon, she vowed to fight Heseltine to the \\nfinish. \\n\\n\\nBut late Wednesday, a steady stream of ministers and aides -- dubbed the \"men \\nin gray suits\" -- called at 10 Downing St., most of them warning her that she \\nmight lose next Tuesday\\'s second ballot against Heseltine. Her husband, Denis, \\nalso reportedly urged her to step down. \\n\\n\\nRather than face the humiliation of defeat against a \"backbench\" member of \\nParliament -- one who is not a party leader -- the prime minister reflected \\nlong and hard and then, on Thursday morning, decided to step down, political \\nsources said. She was driven to Buckingham Palace to inform -ueen Elizabeth II, \\nwho ultimately appoints prime ministers. \\n\\n\\nHer official announcement said: \"Having consulted widely among colleagues, I \\nhave concluded that the unity of the party and prospects of victory in a \\ngeneral election would be better served if I stood down to enable Cabinet \\ncolleagues to enter the ballot for the leadership.\" \\n\\n\\nIn effect, Thatcher was forced from office -- a development that has surprised \\nand confused many observers abroad, since she still has not lost any election. \\n\\n\\nThe question raised in political circles Thursday was whether Heseltine\\'s \\naction would help or hurt the party in the run-up to the next election. \\nHeseltine has run well ahead of Thatcher in nationwide opinion polls, but his \\nopposition to the prime minister will be held against him by many colleagues. \\n\\n\\nThatcher\\'s daughter, Carol, spoke for many loyalists when she said of the \\nactions that forced her mother\\'s resignation: \"I think it is the most gutless \\nact of treachery -- after all she has done.\" \\n\\n\\nMember of Parliament Alan Clark declared of the Tories\\' leadership vote last \\nTuesday: \"It was a cowardly act to save their seats. They hid behind a cloak of \\nanonymity and voted against a leader who had run three elections. \\n\\n\\n\"She was elected by 30 million people and tossed out by 150.\" \\n\\n\\nEx-Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit, a Thatcher loyalist, said, \"I think this was \\na dreadful mistake, dumping the prime minister.\" \\n\\n\\nNovelist Jeffrey Archer, a former deputy Tory chairman, said, \"For all the \\nwrong reasons, we have lost the greatest peacetime leader of this century.\" \\n\\n\\nParty Chairman Kenneth Baker, who urged her to stay in the race, said: \"I am \\nvery sad. It was a typically brave and selfless decision. She was an \\noutstanding leader of our country and the world. I do not believe we will see \\nher like again.\" \\n\\n\\nFormer Deputy Prime Minister Howe, who began the erosion of her position, said, \\n\"She will always be remembered as one of the greatest political leaders in our \\nhistory.\" \\n\\n\\nOf the three candidates for the Conservative leadership, there is still no \\nclear favorite. \\n\\n\\nHeseltine, who ran so strongly against Thatcher last week, would seem to be the \\nfront-runner, but some Tory lawmakers are thought to have voted for him mainly \\nas a way of casting a ballot against Thatcher. \\n\\n\\nFor his part, Heseltine said of the resignation, \"She has made a remarkable \\ncontribution to Britain\\'s history and has led the country with great \\ndistinction in the 1980s.\" \\n\\n\\nHurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer Major, who are friends, said they both \\ndecided to join Heseltine in the race so that their colleagues could choose the \\ncandidate most likely to unify the party and take it into the next general \\nelection. \\n\\n\\nAs Hurd put it, \"We could have done this in a smoke-filled room, but this is \\nthe more open way for the party to make a decision.\" \\n\\n\\nBoth he and Major have wide appeal among their colleagues in Parliament. \\n\\n\\nHurd is the most experienced in tough jobs. He was a secretary for Northern \\nIreland and the Home Office before becoming foreign secretary. \\n\\n\\nMajor, 47, is the bright young man of the party, who seems to have few enemies. \\nHowever, some of his colleagues suggest that because of his youth, he may \\ncomfortably be passed over for now. \\n\\n\\nEdwina Currie, a controversial member of Parliament who was forced out of the \\nThatcher government and is a Heseltine supporter, argued Thursday that the \\nthree-man race is an \"undignified scramble.\" \\n\\n\\n\"At a time like this, the Cabinet should be sticking together and putting \\nforward one name,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nFor Thatcher\\'s supporters, her bold handling of the Laborites\\' no-confidence \\nmotion Thursday made her departure from government even more difficult to \\naccept. \\n\\n\\nBut, as one said, \"there are no happy endings in politics.\" \\n\\n\\nWorldwide reaction to Thatcher\\'s announcement reflects admiration for her \\nachievements.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nOctober 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWS ANALYSIS; \\n\\n\\nCABINET CHAOS OPENS DEEP WOUNDS FOR THATCHER; \\n\\n\\nBRITAIN: \\'SHE WILL BE A LESS POWERFUL PRIME MINISTER FOR MONTHS,\\' PREDICTS ONE \\nEXPERT. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher \"has never been worried about people loving \\nher,\" one of her closest aides boasted to a small audience of foreigners \\nearlier this week. She has strong views and says what she thinks. At the risk \\nof sounding corny, the aide elaborated, you could characterize her philosophy \\nas: \"To thine own self be true.\" \\n\\n\\nThat depiction seemed particularly ironic less than 48 hours later, after a \\nduplicitous bit of personnel management by Thatcher blew up in the surprise \\nresignation of her longtime chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson. \\n\\n\\nThe resignation triggered a wholesale shake-up of top Cabinet posts, brought \\nturmoil to the financial markets, and inspired some of the harshest criticism \\nof Thatcher in the decade she has been in power. \\n\\n\\nThe Bank of England intervened heavily Friday morning to stop a slump in the \\nvalue of the pound triggered by uncertainty over the country\\'s future economic \\npolicy. Prices also fell sharply on the London Stock Exchange, despite \\nThatcher\\'s assurance that government policies will continue \"precisely as they \\nwere, so we shall have complete continuity.\" \\n\\n\\nThe British press was filled Friday with talk of political \"crisis,\" even \\nthough few here see the prime minister in any immediate danger of losing her \\njob. Still, according to many analysts, the affair has opened deep wounds which \\nat the very least will diminish her political maneuvering room. \\n\\n\\n\"She will be a less powerful prime minister for months, or possibly right up to \\nthe next election,\" said Anthony King, professor of government at Essex \\nUniversity and a respected political commentator. \\n\\n\\nOn Friday, the Independent titled its lead editorial, \"The Prime Minister Who \\nBetrayed Her Own Government.\" It concluded that while she may remain in office, \\n\"her great days are over.\" \\n\\n\\nEven the tabloid Sun, Britain\\'s largest-circulation newspaper and ardently \\npro-Thatcher, conceded that her position was \"inevitably . . . shaken\" by the \\naffair. \\n\\n\\nLawson resigned Thursday after Thatcher refused his demand that she fire Alan \\nWalters, her personal economic adviser, over public comments critical of the \\nchancellor\\'s policies. Within a couple of hours, Walters also resigned and \\nThatcher had a new finance minister, John Major. \\n\\n\\nAlthough Lawson may have reacted partly to hurt pride, the affair goes much \\ndeeper than that. Walters had been speaking out for at least 18 months, since \\nlong before Thatcher hired him as a $50,000-a-year, part-time adviser last May. \\nHis position was thus seen as a clear slight to Lawson, who is the Cabinet \\nofficer supposedly in charge of government economic policy. \\n\\n\\nIn fact, Thatcher has had policy differences with Lawson for months, and \\nWalters\\' presence at No. 10 Downing Street was a constant reminder of the \\ntension. \\n\\n\\n\"Here we have a chancellor whose position has been rendered intolerable by an \\nagent of the leader,\" Thatcher biographer Hugo Young wrote in the Guardian. \\n\"Her taunting of Lawson, by failing instantly to repudiate Walters, drove the \\nlast big man out\" of her Cabinet. \\n\\n\\nThe conservative Daily Telegraph, in an otherwise sympathetic editorial, chided \\nthe prime minister: \"Leadership, in which she excels, must not degenerate into \\ndominance, intolerance, and a simple refusal to work with those she has \\nappointed to serve her. Even before the Lawson decision, there was mounting \\nevidence in the country of a certain restlessness with her style.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Financial Times recalled that just three months ago Thatcher shunted aside \\nher longtime foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe. It said that with Lawson\\'s \\ndeparture, she has managed to alienate two important contributors to the \\nrevolutionary changes known as \"Thatcherism.\" \\n\\n\\n\"From being a government of people committed to a set of coherent, radical and \\ntimely ideas, it has now become a government committed to the prime minister \\nherself,\" the newspaper said. \"As she has become more pre-eminent, her \\ngovernment has become much more vulnerable.\" \\n\\n\\nWhat baffled many was the way this most determined of prime ministers was \\napparently so indecisive when it came to a policy conflict between two members \\nof her governing team. Similarly, two years ago, she allowed a Cabinet dispute \\nover how best to save Westland, an ailing government helicopter manufacturer, \\nto fester to the point of rupture. Two of her ministers, Michael Heseltine and \\nLeon Brittan, resigned in that fracas. \\n\\n\\nActually, wrote biographer Young, the Westland affair and Lawson\\'s resignation \\nunderline a common Thatcher leadership tactic that has now received \"its \\ndevastating comeuppance.\" \\n\\n\\nYoung calls it \"covert distancing\" -- endorsing a policy in such a way that \\nthere always remains a suspicion that she opposes it. \"The gift (that her \\ntactic) bestowed, of excusing her for policy failures, was sometimes thought to \\nreveal her political brilliance,\" he wrote. \\n\\n\\nIt works with people as well as policies, said Essex University\\'s King, who \\nsaid in an interview that Thatcher has a habit of \"referring to other members \\nof her own government as \\'them\\' and \\'they\\' as if she didn\\'t have anything to do \\nwith it.\" \\n\\n\\nIn the aftermath of Lawson\\'s embarrassing resignation, King predicted, Thatcher \\nwill be forced to revert \"to something more like the British norm of collective \\nleadership.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Independent\\'s highly regarded political columnist Peter Jenkins noted that \\nthe immediate policy issue underlying Lawson\\'s departure was a dispute over \\nfull British membership in the European Monetary System. This is a step that \\nThatcher is loathe to take because it might amount to ceding partial control \\nover her country\\'s economic policy to the European Community. \\n\\n\\n\"Europe has been the issue underlying most of Mrs. Thatcher\\'s biggest errors,\" \\nJenkins wrote. \"Europe was at the root of the Westland affair, which in 1986 \\nprovoked the resignation from the Cabinet of Michael Heseltine and, by her own \\nadmission, could have brought her down. \\n\\n\\n\"It was Europe which drove her to excesses which helped to lose her the \\nelections to the European Parliament last June. Europe was the issue on which \\nshe sacked . . . (Howe) from the Foreign Office last summer, badly upsetting \\nher party in the process.\" \\n\\n\\nThe question of Britain\\'s future role in a more united Europe \"is the big, \\nseismic issue of the 1990s,\" agreed John Barnes, a lecturer in government at \\nthe London School of Economics, \"and it\\'s one the Tories are ill-equipped to \\nhandle at the moment.\" \\n\\n\\nBarnes, who is an acknowledged expert on the Conservatives, said in an \\ninterview that \"if Mrs. Thatcher withdrew (from office) at this point, there\\'d \\nbe a huge sigh of relief\" among many in the party. However, he said, he sees \\nlittle chance of her stepping down voluntarily. Meanwhile, \"the only way there \\nwould be a coup against her in the Conservative party is if all the possible \\nsuccessors agreed on one of them,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nThat is an unlikely possibility, King agreed. \"Who is going to take risks with \\nhis political career to make someone else prime minister?\" he asked. \\n\\n\\nBut with the revitalized, opposition Labor Party already looking more like a \\ncredible alternative than at any time in the last decade, and Thatcher\\'s \\ngovernment slipping in the polls, Lawson\\'s startling departure clearly adds to \\nthe prime minister\\'s troubles. \\n\\n\\nAs the Guardian said Friday: \"Politically, this is one hell of a mess.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHO\\'S WHO IN CABINET CRISIS \\n\\n\\nMargaret Thatcher, in midst of the worst political crisis in her decade in \\npower, shuffles her Cabinet. \\n\\n\\nNigel Lawson -- His resignation Thursday as chancellor of the exchequer \\nastonishes Parliament. \\n\\n\\nAlan Walters -- Thatcher\\'s personal economic adviser, who feuded with Lawson, \\nalso quits. \\n\\n\\nJohn Major -- A former Lawson assistant, he replaces his former boss in the \\nexchequer post. \\n\\n\\nDouglas Hurd -- He moves from the Home Office to head the Foreign Office. \\n\\n\\nDavid Waddington -- Parliament\\'s chief business manager, he replaces Hurd as \\nHome Secretary. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Combined with the\\ncontinuing rift over Europe, this has given the impression of a party\\nravaged by civil war.\\nLady Thatcher fanned the flames earlier this week by criticising the\\ngovernment's plans to extend value added tax to domestic fuel. Party leaders\\nare now bracing themselves for an interview with the former prime minister\\nto be published in this week's Sunday Times, which is to start serialising\\nher memoirs on October 10.\\nIn a separate development, Lady Thatcher has agreed to help raise money for\\nthe party by attending one or two fund-raising dinners early next year.\\nThe party said last night it welcomed the move both as a gesture of\\nreconciliation and because the former prime minister is a successful\\nfund-raiser. The party had an accumulated deficit of Pounds 19m at the end\\nof March this year.\\nLady Thatcher is expected to arrive in Blackpool on Wednesday night and to\\nappear on the conference platform the following day for the debates on\\nemployment and the economy.\\nThis means she is likely to be present when Mr David Hunt and Mr Kenneth\\nClarke - two of the most left-leaning members of Mr Major's cabinet - are\\nspeaking.\\nThe chancellor is almost certain to face calls both to rethink VAT on fuel\\nand to rule out Budget tax increases altogether.\\nMr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, plans to address a conference\\nfringe meeting on Thursday, just three weeks after his scathing criticism of\\npolicy in a daily newspaper.\\nLord Tebbit, the former party chairman, will also be active, with three\\nfringe appearances, culminating in a high-profile debate with Mr Clarke on\\nthe future of Conservatism.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nNovember 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ROMANCE IS OVER; THE ANGLO PARTNERSHIP PALES; \\n\\n\\nTHATCHER: SHE WAS A SYMBIOTIC ALLY TO REAGAN AND THEN BUSH; SHE SIMPLY LOST HER \\nOWN PARTY\\'S ALLEGIANCE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the Persian \\nGulf on Thanksgiving Day. He heard the news of Margaret Thatcher\\'s resignation \\nas he celebrated the holiday in the Saudi desert -- and it clearly came as a \\nshock. In the State Department, too, it came as a shock. Americans who had come \\nto take Thatcher for granted during her 11 years of power were not prepared for \\nher passing. \\n\\n\\nThatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her \\nnarrow failure to retain the premiership outright on Tuesday. The feeling \\neverywhere was that Thatcher always stuck to her word. So no problem. Pass the \\nturkey. \\n\\n\\nThatcher\\'s friends all over the world had reckoned without the British \\nConservative Party, which had looked at the opinion polls, the bad economic \\nnews and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election. They had \\nreckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant Michael Heseltine among the \\nmiddle-ranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects \\nif the unpredictable \"Tarzan\" came to power. \\n\\n\\nIt was an extraordinary scene in the palace of Westminster on Wednesday night \\nas one by one her own Cabinet members trooped sheepishly into Thatcher\\'s office \\nand told her, in their chosen code, that they \"couldn\\'t support her over the \\nweekend\" in the second round of secret balloting on the party\\'s leadership. \\nTherefore, if Heseltine was to be beaten, it had to be by someone else. After \\n\"sleeping on it,\" as one of her closest advisers put it, Thatcher reluctantly \\nconcluded that she had to go. Thus did the toughest fighter for shared British \\nand American values since Winston Churchill become the first prime minister to \\nbe forced out of office by the Conservative Party since the failed war leader \\nNeville Chamberlain. \\n\\n\\nWhen George Bush recovered from his Thanksgiving surprise, he was generous in \\nhis praise. Two years ago, his words would have rung hollow. The President \\nbegan his term in office without much trust in her. He had seen the influence \\nshe exerted over Ronald Reagan and was keen to be seen as his own man. He had \\nheard her doubts over the pace of German reunification and the integration of \\nEurope, and had been persuaded by his advisers that she stood against the \\nUnited States\\' best interests. \\n\\n\\nGradually, however, that changed. At the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, \\nthe President deliberately sought Thatcher\\'s analysis. It was her assessment of \\nthe threat to international security posed by Iraqi aggression that, according \\nto British and American sources, set the moral framework for Operation Desert \\nShield. The pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about Iraq on \\nBush\\'s behalf in the Colorado mountain garden of the U.S. ambassador to \\nBritain, Henry Catto; that marked the public turning point. She was able to \\narticulate what Bush sensed was right. And he was able to defer to her without \\nembarrassment, seeming almost gentlemanly in allowing her to go first. \\n\\n\\nBush is unlikely to reach such a rapport with any of her three potential \\nsuccessors. Heseltine is an exceptionally powerful orator, but it hard to see \\nthat helping the tongue-tied American President. Douglas Hurd, the urbane \\nforeign secretary, is an English James Baker; the President already has a James \\nBaker. John Major, the chancellor of the Exchequer and Thatcher\\'s own choice to \\nsucceed her, may have views very close to Bush\\'s. But he is mild-mannered, \\nslightly clumsy and, although widely liked and admired by his friends, is \\nalmost wholly without international experience. \\n\\n\\nThe issue is no longer the Anglo-American \"special relationship.\" It is \\nMargaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan who will go down in history as Washington \\nand London\\'s \"last romantics.\" They were the ones who would each ditch their \\nclosest friends in order to support the other: Reagan when overruling Jeane \\nKirkpatrick\\'s objections to the Falklands campaign, and Thatcher when blocking \\nher own right wing\\'s protests at the U.S. bombing of Libya from British bases. \\nThey shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back -- and she \\nhelped persuade him that Mikhail Gorbachev was a man who could be trusted. The \\npowerful enunciation of that belief -- and its eventual vindication -- may be \\nthe last great achievement of the special postwar Anglo-American alliance. \\n\\n\\nGeorge Bush and Margaret Thatcher had something more simple in common, a \\npragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both. \\n\\n\\nBritish policy toward Iraq will not change suddenly under a new prime minister. \\nThe doubling of the size of the British gulf force on Thursday attempted \\nemphatically to prove that. But as time goes by, Britain\\'s allies will find \\nthat many certainties have passed along with Margaret Thatcher. If seductive \\ndeals emerge to save the face and the atomic-weapon factories of Saddam \\nHussein, her steadfastness will be sorely missed. \\n\\n\\nAnd if Europe becomes more inward-looking and protectionist, blame those who \\nbooted out the prime minister whose final words to her Cabinet were, \"It\\'s a \\nfunny old world.\" Her memoirs deserve a more dignified title. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nNovember 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PRESS; \\n\\n\\nTORIES\\' TORMENT: WHAT TO DO WITH THATCHER? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlamboyant former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine\\'s challenge to Prime \\nMinister Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party has caused \\na political sensation in Britain. A crucial first vote of Tory Members of \\nParliament (MPs) is scheduled for today, and if Heseltine should wrest control \\nof the party from Thatcher -- the longest-serving British head of government in \\nmodern times -- she would also have to give up the prime minister\\'s job that \\nshe has held since 1979. \\n\\n\\n Here\\'s a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred \\nBritain: \\n\\n\\n \"The Thatcher era in British politics is almost over. . . . It is more likely \\nthan not that she is finished altogether. The coup de grace may not be \\ndelivered at this moment. The nature of the era that comes afterward is far \\nfrom clear. But as a political force, she is condemned at best to an \\nunrelenting rear-guard action which will end sometime in a humiliating abyss. . \\n. . \\n\\n\\n\"The party may sullenly support her now, but they will ask the question again \\nin the spring, knowing that if they do not do so the country will ask the same \\nquestion even more pitilessly when the general election comes. . . . \\n\\n\\n\"An alternative, however, stares her in the face. . . . It is to acknowledge \\nthat an era has passed, and preserve its achievements by standing down, \\nreleasing her lieutenants and urging her party, in the interests of a vanished \\nunity, to support Mr. (Foreign Minister Douglas) Hurd.\" \\n\\n\\n -- Thatcher biographer Hugo Young in The Guardian \\n\\n\\n\"The contest for the leadership of the Conservative party . . . should not be \\noccurring. . . . \\n\\n\\n\"It would be foolish to deny that, today, the prime minister is politically \\nbeleaguered as never before. . . . But the task of the Conservative party, in \\nthe year and more that remains before the next general election, must be to \\nrally to enable Mrs. Thatcher to rebuild her personal position, and give her \\nthe confidence and support to win the fourth term she deserves.\" \\n\\n\\n -- The Daily Telegraph \\n\\n\\n\"Who could have guessed . . . from watching the prime minister answer questions \\nin the Commons that she was fighting for her life? She was as brisk and \\nwell-briefed as ever. . . . \\n\\n\\n\"Bloodied Margaret Thatcher may be. Bowed she most certainly is not.\" \\n\\n\\n -- Daily Mail \\n\\n\\n\"British Conservative MPs must be prepared to reject Mrs. Thatcher when they \\nvote in the party\\'s leadership election. . . . It is no longer in the interests \\nof the United Kingdom, which are now inextricably linked with the development \\nof a strong and united Europe, for her to remain in office. \\n\\n\\n\"The European derives no satisfaction from reaching this conclusion. Apart from \\nher domestic achievements in reviving the British economy in the 1980s, Mrs. \\nThatcher has contributed much more to the development of the European Community \\nthan she is often given credit for. . . . \\n\\n\\n\"But The European believes that her nightmare vision of Europe, of \\nill-intentioned people trying to destroy democracy, is not shared by most of \\nthe British people. They reject her view that pooling of sovereignty is no \\ndifferent from surrender. . . . \\n\\n\\n \"The Conservative Party faces a stark choice. Either it will reelect Mrs. \\nThatcher and see the United Kingdom slip into isolation as it is left behind \\nthe rest of the Community. Or it can choose a new leader who is prepared to \\nparticipate genuinely in the argument about economic and political union.\" \\n\\n\\n -- The European \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \"A prime minister in total command for 11 years could not be unseated, and \\ncherished policies abandoned, without an explosion within the party. It would \\ntake a Solomon to heal the divisions and prevent civil war. Frankly, we cannot \\nsee Mr. Heseltine in that role. \\n\\n\\n\"The Sun also deeply questions his ability to be a successful or even adequate \\nprime minister. . . . This is the man who for the past five years has professed \\nloyalty to the government and yet has been its most divisive force. We discern \\njust one constant loyalty -- and that is to Michael Heseltine.\" \\n\\n\\n -- The Sun \\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. Thatcher deserves better than to be dismissed in the shoddy and demeaning \\nmanner some Tory MPs are minded to have in store for her. To be defeated by the \\npeople in a general election, as was Winston Churchill in 1945, that was an \\nhonorable rejection. To be brought down by a vote of censure in the House of \\nCommons, as was Neville Chamberlain in 1940 -- even that was a constitutionally \\nrespectable form of political demise. But what they are proposing to do to Mrs. \\nThatcher, unquestionably the greatest peacetime prime minister of this century, \\nis quite simply unworthy. Her fate could be sealed, if her opponents have their \\nway, behind closed doors in smoke-filled rooms. . . . Persons of quality were \\nalways accorded the dignity of execution by ax or firing squad, rather than the \\nhumiliation of hanging. These plotters would like to dispatch Mrs. Thatcher, \\nwho almost single-handedly has won three elections, by the political equivalent \\nof the rope. . . . \\n\\n\\n\"You can find Heseltines wherever you go. But there is only one Mrs. Thatcher. \\nHandle with care. This valuable object is irreplaceable.\" \\n\\n\\n -- The Sunday Telegraph \\n\\n\\n\"This newspaper has long maintained that the best result in the next general \\nelection would be for Margaret Thatcher to lead the Tories to a fourth victory. \\nSadly, the course of events has conspired to make that unlikely. . . . \\n\\n\\n\"The British have never liked Margaret Thatcher; but as long as she delivered \\nthe goods they respected her, and voted for her. When her government fails (as \\nit has recently), that lack of affection turns to growing resentment. For \\nreasons that are probably unfair and undeserved, Mrs. Thatcher is now a victim \\nof that strongest public mood of all: time for a change. . . . \\n\\n\\n\"Mrs. Thatcher is right to feel bitter that a prime minister with her track \\nrecord and prestige can be so easily challenged. If she goes, the manner of her \\nousting will leave much to be desired; no other party could so lightly dispose \\nof its leader in government, this side of an election, largely for reasons of \\nunpopularity. But the Tories have a nose for survival in power unmatched by any \\nother party in the democratic world, and politics is an unforgiving business. \\nThe issue before Tory MPs . . . is not the reelection of Margaret Thatcher, it \\nis the defeat of (opposition Labor Party leader) Neil Kinnock. That requires \\nsaying a reluctant goodby to Mrs. Thatcher, and the endorsement of Michael \\nHeseltine.\" \\n\\n\\n -- The Sunday Times \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n931006\\n\\n\\nFT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Loyalty to the Lady\\nsplits party faithful - Tories from the shires tell Kevin Brown what they\\nthink of the ex-leader\\n\\n\\nFOR SOME, it will be like old times. Three years after she was\\nunceremoniously ditched by Conservative MPs, Baroness Thatcher arrives in\\nBlackpool today guaranteed an ecstatic welcome and a standing ovation from\\nthe faithful.\\nThe party leadership is betting that her appearance on the platform\\nalongside Mr John Major, the prime minister, will ram home the primary\\nconference message - that the disunity of the last year is over. But will\\nit?\\nA highly unscientific straw poll taken in the bars and tea-rooms of the\\nWinter Gardens conference centre suggests that many constituency\\nrepresentatives would like the former prime minister to shut up, but few\\nexpect her to.\\nIt also revealed something less predictable: in spite of the widespread\\nreporting of Lady Thatcher's private view that Mr Major is a weak prime\\nminister, a sizeable number of delegates think it inconceivable that she\\ncould be disloyal to the current high command.\\n'I think she is too much of a politician to say anything out of line. I\\ndon't think she is in a position to criticise John Major because he is the\\nleader,' said Mr Ray Richardson, a businessman from the Black Country.\\n'I was a great supporter of Margaret Thatcher when she was in power, but my\\nview is she supports the prime minister. She's got to hasn't she?\\n'I think the very fact that Margaret Thatcher is coming to the conference\\nshows her backing for John Major. She is certainly not going to criticise\\nhim because she is a strong ally of the Conservative party and the country.'\\nOthers were not so sure, especially when reminded of Lady Thatcher's\\nforthcoming memoirs and her apparent desire to promote the succession\\nchances of Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the\\nTreasury.\\n'I thought she would be above (disloyalty),' said Mrs Peggy Jones from\\nGower. 'I don't know if she is really saying these things or if it is just\\nthe newspapers, but if she is saying them it would be disloyal.'\\nShe added: 'I think she should make it clear that she is standing behind\\nJohn Major. She should say that she supports his policies.'\\nMr Bernard McArdle, a Blackpool councillor, was convinced that the image of\\na reunited party being projected by the leadership was not a facade, and\\ncertain that the conference would launch Mr Major on a sustained recovery.\\nBut he thought Lady Thatcher's memoirs, to be published later this month,\\nwould probably be less than complimentary about many Conservative\\npoliticians, including Mr Major.\\n'I would expect her to be critical because she is a very critical person.\\nShe has always been a very straightforward, honest person, and I think she\\nwill be critical of herself as well,' he said.\\n'But I don't think she will be disloyal. Some people might interpret some of\\nthe things she says as disloyal, but loyalty to the party is in her blood.'\\nBut what about her apparent manoeuverings on behalf of Mr Portillo?\\n'I would not put that past her. She is the mother of the party, isn't she?\\nThere is a motherly instinct, and she doesn't want to see it all fail. She\\nwants to make sure there is someone else, to her liking, to make sure it\\ncarries on.'\\nThe corridors of the Winter Gardens are not exactly swarming with\\nunreconstructed Thatcherites, but, equally, you don't have to go far to find\\none.\\nMrs Pamela Windsor from East Surrey said she was 'devastated' by the exit of\\nthe former leader, and nearly 'gave up politics to take up knitting or\\nsomething'.\\nMrs Windsor thinks Mr Major is 'following the wrong policies,' and believes\\nthat Lady Thatcher should have stayed in office for at least a further five\\nyears.\\nShe is also one of many representatives who profess sympathy for the\\nrightwing MPs whose critical 'noises off' have so upset Mr Major. 'Good luck\\nto them,' she said.\\nBut could Lady Thatcher not best unify the party and protect her own legacy\\nby giving wholehearted support to Mr Major?\\n'If I had been her I would have been much more spiteful. I think she has\\nbeen very restrained,' she said.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Her friends then flatly denied\\nreports that she had referred in the book to her successor as\\n'intellectually lightweight', 'politically naive' or 'small-minded'.\\nBeyond those phrases there was little sensational in the leaked report. But\\nthe memoirs are understood to reflect Lady Thatcher's view - expressed\\nfrequently to confidants - that Mr Major has failed to display firm\\nleadership. One senior Conservative who has seen a manuscript of the memoirs\\ndescribed the report as 'exaggerated but broadly accurate'.\\nThe row destabilised attempts by the party leadership to create a public\\ndisplay of unity during what is seen as a critical week in Mr Major's\\nefforts to restore his political authority.\\nWith Lady Thatcher due to arrive in Blackpool today and appear alongside Mr\\nMajor tomorrow, senior ministers maintained a public display of indifference\\nto her alleged criticisms.

Final \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHATCHER AT NEW LOW IN OPINION POLL; \\n\\n\\nGREAT BRITAIN: THE FUROR OVER THE TOP TREASURY OFFICIAL\\'S RESIGNATION HEIGHTENS \\nCRITICISM OF THE PRIME MINISTER\\'S LEADERSHIP STYLE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher, her government rocked by the resignation of \\nher top treasury official, sank today to the worst ratings of her decade in \\npower. \\n\\n\\nOne sounding showed her the most unpopular leader since polling began here. \\n\\n\\n\"She cannot afford many more mishaps,\" said Norman Tebbit, former chairman of \\nthe governing Conservative Party who helped mastermind Thatcher\\'s third \\nsuccessive election victory in 1987. \\n\\n\\nIn a National Opinion Poll sounding, Thatcher hit the lowest popularity rating \\nfor any prime minister since polling started in Britain 50 years ago. \\n\\n\\nOnly 24% of a sample of 935 voters questioned said they were satisfied with her \\nperformance and 61% blamed her for Thursday\\'s sudden resignation of Chancellor \\nof the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. \\n\\n\\nHe said he could not continue in the 22-member Cabinet so long as Thatcher \\nretained a personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, who opposes having \\nBritain fully join the European Monetary System that links key European \\ncurrencies. Walters then also resigned. \\n\\n\\nThatcher is lukewarm toward membership of the system\\'s currency-stabilizing \\nexchange rate mechanism while Lawson and Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe \\nfavor it. She fired Howe as foreign secretary last June. \\n\\n\\nTebbit, one of Thatcher\\'s closest political associates, described the latest \\nforced Cabinet shuffle as \"an appalling political muddle.\\' \\n\\n\\n\"She should remember it is dangerous for a captain to appear semidetached from \\nthe team,\" Tebbit wrote in London\\'s Evening Standard. \\n\\n\\nThe furor has heightened criticism of Thatcher\\'s style as bossy, hectoring and \\nintolerant of opposing views in the Cabinet. \\n\\n\\nThe National Opinion Poll, published in a London newspaper, The Independent, \\nwas taken by telephone in the three days after Lawson quit and the British \\nmedia reported the government in crisis. \\n\\n\\nThatcher already held the unpopularity record when she scored a 25% satisfied \\nrating in Gallup and Market Opinion and Research International polls in 1981 \\nwhen the effects of her tight-money policies sent unemployment soaring. \\n\\n\\nLabor Party Prime Minister Harold Wilson held the previous unpopularity record \\nof 27% satisfied in a 1968 Gallup sounding. \\n\\n\\nThe National Opinion Poll showed 62% of those questioned said they were \\ndissatisfied with Thatcher. Fourteen percent had no opinion. \\n\\n\\nA Harris Poll for the BBC-TV current affairs program \"Panorama\" being screened \\ntonight showed the Conservatives 13 points behind the socialist Labor Party. \\nFifty-two percent of those questioned said Thatcher should resign. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Lord Pym says she was\\nagainst any suggestion of compromise, 'which meant she had a confrontational\\nstyle'. Lord Gilmour thinks her judgment was misguided. 'She very seldom\\nsaid a sentence in itself that was interesting. Rather surprising in all\\nthose years.'\\nIn a BBC documentary series, Thatcher: The Downing Street Years, starting\\ntonight, victims of the former prime minister describe their intense dislike\\nof her manner. Lady Thatcher's quotation of St Francis of Assisi, beginning\\n'where there is discord, may we bring harmony', is attacked by Lord Prior,\\nher former employment secretary, as 'complete humbug' and 'hypocritical'. It\\nwas 'utter nonsense' for her to have used the quotation as she was the last\\nperson to believe in harmony.\\nLord Pym, her former foreign secretary, says her distain for compromise made\\nit very difficult to have constructive cabinet meetings. 'The idea that\\nsomebody else might have a valid point of view which might be a right point\\nof view would never enter her mind at all. Not part of her philosophy.'\\nLord Prior discloses that Lord Soames, who was leader of the House of the\\nLords, told him that he would not have treated his gamekeeper as badly as\\nLady Thatcher treated one of her cabinet.\\nLord Gilmour recalls how he and Lord Carrington, who were then lord privy\\nseal and foreign secretary respectively, tried to negotiate a Pounds 1bn\\nrefund from the EC at the 1979 Dublin summit and ended with only two thirds\\nof that amount. They thought they had done rather well. But when they told\\nher, she became 'incandescent'.\\nLord Gilmour says: 'Had we been bailiffs coming to take away the furniture I\\nthink we would have been more cordially received. She was like a sort of\\nfirework, and one could almost hear her almost sizzling.'\\nLord Carrington believes Lady Thatcher 'did the Foreign Office a great deal\\nof damage'. He has also said: 'All of us had learned over 30 years or so to\\ncome to compromises. This is something she hadn't started to learn.'\\nLady Thatcher recognises that she was unpopular with many colleagues and\\nthroughout the country but was determined to stick to her guns. 'My name was\\nmud with some of my colleagues. They always wanted, some of them, an easy\\nway. But I always had enough to get us through.'\\nShe says they talked of her as 'that woman'.

She has survived a vote of \\nconfidence taken by her party colleagues in the House of Commons, winning 204 \\nvotes against 152 for former defense minister Michael Heseltine. But under Tory \\nparty rules, that margin, representing something less than a ringing \\nendorsement, forces Thatcher to face a second round of voting on Tuesday. Other \\ncandidates could choose to stand against her, perhaps diluting the opposition \\nvote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head. \\nBut her reelection is hardly assured. \\n\\n\\nPolls show the Tories would do better in the next national elections with \\nsomeone other than Thatcher leading them. But elections don't have to be called \\nuntil mid-1992; Thatcher's public standing could conceivably increase by then. \\nThatcher has served as PM longer than anyone in this century. She led her party \\nto victory in three elections, steered it through the war with Argentina to \\nreclaim the Falklands, faced down the miners union in a long strike, moved -- \\noften drastically -- to reverse Britain's economic decline and won a prominent \\nplace on the world stage. \\n\\n\\nBut 11 1/2 years in office is a long time. Memory and feelings being what they \\nare, it is the mistakes and irritations of this long tenure that are more \\nlikely to be immediately recalled, while its achievements are left to history \\nto salute. Thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home \\nand a somewhat tiresome scold within the European Community. Her government is \\ndeeply identified with high interest rates, inflation and a flat tax on every \\nadult (in place of the property tax) that is generally regarded as hugely \\nunfair.

REPRESSION CAN\\'T STOP IT. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTen days ago, in Algiers\\' modern seafront Ibn Khaldoun Hall, the Middle East \\npassed a little-noticed milestone. Mohammed Salah Mohamedi, Algeria\\'s \\nsoft-spoken, graying interior minister, revealed the stunning news. It took \\nonly three minutes. The country\\'s first multiparty election since independence \\nfrom France 28 years ago, he announced solemnly, had been swept by Islamic \\nfundamentalists. \\n\\n\\nThen he walked out, leaving behind a thunderstruck crowd. \\n\\n\\nNot since the 1979 Iranian revolution has an Islamic party\\'s victory been so \\ndecisive. And never before has Islam so overwhelmingly routed a long-dominant \\npower by democratic means. \\n\\n\\nIn a world topsy-turvy with new political formulations, Islam has now proved \\nthat it is among the most dynamic and energetic forces. And the reverberations \\nof what happened in Algeria are not limited to the Middle East. \\n\\n\\nFrom India\\'s Kashmir and the Soviet Union\\'s Asian republics, through the Arab \\nheartland and into North Africa, every victory for Allah fuels the \\nfundamentalists\\' simplistic campaign slogan: \"Islam is the solution.\" \\n\\n\\nYet the Algerian campaign was qualitatively different from the vengeful Islamic \\nconvulsions witnessed in Iran\\'s revolution and the takeover of Saudi Arabia\\'s \\nGrand Mosque in 1979, in the violent aftermath of Egyptian President Anwar \\nSadat\\'s assassination in 1981, and in Lebanese extremism since 1982. \\n\\n\\nThe decisive victories by the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria\\'s municipal \\nand regional elections \"demonstrated that Islamicists can work within the \\nsystem and abide by the rules of the game. That\\'s a plus for liberalism,\" said \\nJohn Entelis, an Algerian expert at Fordham University. \\n\\n\\nIndeed, what happened in Algeria, a socialist state, now confirms a trend that \\nhas been emerging during the past three years in disparate political systems. \\n\\n\\nIn Egypt, a nation inching slowly toward democracy, the Muslim Brotherhood \\nbecame the largest opposition force in the National Assembly in 1987. In \\nJordan, a monarchy, the first election in 22 years resulted, in 1989, in a new \\nParliament with more than one-third fundamentalists. \\n\\n\\nIn this second phase of the Islamic resurgence, the Iranian model has been \\nshunned and fanatics\\' bullets forsaken for ballots of moderation. Islam and \\ndemocracy may not be incompatible. \\n\\n\\nIslam\\'s victories, of course, have not happened in a vacuum. In Algeria, the \\nIslamic Salvation Front won in part because of the failure of a revolutionary \\nparty that just three decades ago captured the imagination of struggling \\nnations around the world by battling the powerful French Army for independence. \\n\\n\\nDuring the past decade, Algeria has been plagued by strikes and discontent over \\nissues ranging from chronic housing shortages and land policies to education. \\nDuring the last round of violence, in October, 1988, an estimated 400 died. \\n\\n\\nIn this sense, Muslim demands for change are no different than in Eastern \\nEurope. In a country with at least 25% unemployment, people want jobs. In \\nAlgiers, where the legendary Casbah is teeming with several times more people \\nthan it can hold, people want housing. With a $26-billion debt, Algeria has \\nlimited funds to address grievances. Algerians were voting as much against a \\nbankrupt system as for Islam. \\n\\n\\nThe discontent was visible the day the election results were announced. Long \\nlines formed in front of striking gas stations. For three days, Algiers was \\nwithout newspapers, also on strike. Garbage collectors joined the boycott; \\npiles of garbage accumulated on streets throughout the Mediterranean capital. \\n\\n\\nNor, of course, does Islam have all the solutions. Despite its motto, the \\nIslamic Salvation Front\\'s campaign lacked specific cures for Algeria\\'s \\nproblems. But Islamic groups are providing alternatives. \\n\\n\\nIn response to the garbage strike, bearded men dressed in coarse-cotton \\ngalibeyah robes, the traditional Algerian dress, collected the slimy piles of \\nrefuse with their bare hands. The front had mobilized its followers. \\n\\n\\nIn Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood also boasted \"Islam is the solution,\" \\nIslamic societies have established hundreds of clinics and schools with \\nfirst-rate social services at no or marginal cost -- in stark contrast to \\ncostly private facilities and inefficient government institutions. \\n\\n\\nThe risky gambles by the leaders of Algeria, Egypt and Jordan in opening the \\npolitical dikes may offer a lesson in how to deal with Islam: Include \\nfundamentalists rather than confront them. Co-opt the Islamic tide by forcing \\nthem to share the burden of solving staggering problems. \\n\\n\\nIndeed, one of the reasons Islam has become so potent is due to the absence of \\ndemocratic outlets -- in Algeria for 28 years, in Jordan for 22 and in Egypt, \\nwhere the Muslim Brotherhood has been banned since 1954, for 33 years. \\n\\n\\nThe alternative is evident in Tunisia, which held local elections the day \\nbefore Algeria\\'s election. After fundamentalists running as independents won \\n12% in last year\\'s legislative election, the government banned the Islamic En \\nNahda, or the Renaissance Party, from running. \\n\\n\\nTunisia claimed that the ruling party won 99% of the vote, which both European \\nand U.S. officials conceded was hardly representative in a country also \\nwitnessing strong Islamic political fervor. En Nahda\\'s moderate leader, Rachid \\nGhannouchi, recently said that he feared the government\\'s intransigence would \\nlead to open confrontation and bloodshed. \\n\\n\\nA different danger is growing in Israel\\'s occupied territories. Prolonged \\nsuspension of the U.S. talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization and the \\nPLO\\'s inability to show progress in its political strategy are almost certain \\nto increase the appeal of two Islamic groups -- one comparatively moderate, the \\nother extremist -- that have taken deep root since the intifada began in 1987. \\n\\n\\nDealing the Islamic card is still, however, a risk. The excesses and rhetoric \\nafter decades of suppression will frighten both Middle East and Western \\ngovernments. But the beards and the veils, the militant chants of the mosques\\' \\nmuezzins and the raids on bars that sell alcohol are smaller threats than \\nfurther repression. \\n\\n\\nAgain, Algeria is a test case. The Islamic Salvation Front has two \\n\"tendencies\": One pledges support for Algeria\\'s emerging multiparty democracy. \\nThe other advocates an Islamic regime and spouts fiery warnings about \\nMohammed\\'s army marching on the Jews. \\n\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the June 12 vote, Algeria may be forced to bring forward \\nparliamentary elections not required until 1992. The front has demanded that \\nthey be held within three months. \\n\\n\\nThis week, the ruling National Liberation Front appealed for an alliance of \\nsecular parties to oppose the Islamic front. And it rejected \"all attempts to \\nbring Islam back to an era of charlatanism and myth and make it an instrument \\nof demogogy and political opportunism.\" \\n\\n\\nSince up to 40% of the electorate did not vote, the National Liberation Front \\ncould make a partial comeback. And President Chadli Bendjedid\\'s term is not up \\nuntil 1994. \\n\\n\\nBut, again, confrontation will only encourage extremism. The threshold has \\nalready been crossed in Algeria. \\n\\n\\n\"Whether or not the (National Liberation Front) clings to power, the name of \\nthe game has now changed irrevocably,\\' said Augustus Richard Norton, a Middle \\nEast specialist at the U.S. Military Academy. \"The revolution in Iran \\ndistracted us from the real political wave in Islam, which is the struggle for \\ndomestic justice and survival.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n\\nBFN \\n\\n [Statement issued by the Presidency of the Republic; date \\nnot given] \\n  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Brother citizens, the National \\nSalvation Revolution was begun in the defense of this homeland, \\nwhich had been overwhelmed by the dangers of fragmentation and \\ninfighting. National unity was threatened and the economy was \\nin a state of collapse and stagnation. Corruption and nepotism \\nwere rampant because of the weakness of the rulers and the \\nabsence of a true course and higher ideals. Further fuel was \\nadded to the fire by party differences and improper press \\npractices linked to private benefits and foreign interests. \\n  The principles of the National Salvation Revolution were \\nopposed to all that. It replaced division with unity. Defense \\nand the struggle for the sake of God and the homeland replaced \\ncaution and surrender to enemies. It raised aloft the ideals of \\npurity and impartiality over and above corruption. It raised \\naloft the banner of the brilliant Islamic law in place of a \\nconfused and baffled course. It worked to establish a new \\nsociety guided by clear ideals linked to heaven. \\n  The revolution established institutions for popular and \\npolitical work and embarked on policies for reforming the \\neconomy, the education sector and society. The ship sailed on, \\nguided by God, confident of victory despite storms, challenges, \\nand trials. \\n  When the revolution provided opportunities for consultation \\nand advice, it issued regulations, but some people, whose minds \\nwere narrowed against the revolution and who hated it, thought \\nthat their opportunity had come to achieve their dreams and the \\ndreams of those who supported them, to drag the country back to \\nthe hated and painful past. Among these was the newspaper \\nAL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI, which gathered a clique blinded by the \\nbrilliance of money which was generously given to them, and by \\nthe fear of the foreigner whom they thought was God disposing of \\nthe universe. They were also friendly to the alliances and the \\nghosts of the past, which feed on illusions and live on mirages. \\n  The paper permits its pens to harm the noblest causes of the \\nhomeland in the struggle and defense of its creed and unity. It \\nraises doubts about the purpose and the struggle of the Armed \\nForces and the popular defense forces. It calls for the \\nseparation and negligence of the unity of the country, for which \\nmany martyrs have fallen and colored with their pure blood. \\n  The martyrs march forward, liberating every inch of the \\ncountry until they attain victory -- and they will attain it, \\nGod willing. \\n  These journalists have worked to fragment national unity by \\nraising doubts about the option of the people and the \\nrevolution, about the political system and the popular and \\nconstitutional bodies. They have called for a return to \\nparties, sectarianism, and tribal conflict. They have waged a \\npsychological war against the Armed Forces and the other regular \\nforces, falsely accusing some of them on having committed \\nexcesses and oppression, and denigrating the strength of others \\nin so far as the protection of the citizens and their property \\nwere concerned. \\n  They resorted to magnifying simple incidents with the \\nintention of influencing the security of citizens and the \\nhomeland. They then raised the charge of corruption and spread \\nrumors, without providing any evidence or proof, in spite of the \\ncall made by the minister of justice, the attorney general, \\nstressing the revolution's readiness and its firm commitment to \\nestablish the truth and to punish anyone whose criminality was \\nproved. They intended by these acts to harm the revolution and \\nits noblest intentions, namely righteousness and impartiality. \\n  Finally they crowned all this with a premeditated design to \\nkill respect for the revolution and its symbols. They became \\narrogant without any justification, committed excesses without \\nany proof, and made allegations without any evidence. \\n  Brothers, the revolution has promised God, then its people, \\nto go to the end of the road to achieve clear victory and God's \\nfavor. It has proffered martyrs as evidence of its sincerity \\nand a sign of devotion, and will not retreat or withdraw. God \\nwilling out of fear, nor will it bow before anyone other than \\nGod. [sentence as heard] \\n  An order has been issued in accordance with emergency rules \\nto close this newspaper. The organs concerned will call to \\naccount all those who have exceeded the bounds and overstepped \\nthe limits. Those who have done wrong shall know the end they \\nwill meet. God is great, glory to Islam, God is great, victory \\nto Sudan. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

The \\nparticipants took this opportunity to express their outrage at \\n\"the fratricidal fight among Algerians, assassination and \\nthreats against intellectuals, the worsening of the political \\nsituation, economic failure, and the rise of political and \\nreligious violence.\" \\n  This situation prompted the ulemas to denounce \"in righteous \\nwords, whatever is counter to divine order, with no fear of \\neither the governing or the governed.\" \\n  In this respect, the meeting gave the organizers an \\nopportunity to announce the forthcoming creation of a Republican \\nIslamic Rally, the TADJ [RIR]. \\n  It would be a nonpartisan movement including all the ulemas \\nand all the Algerians who might feel concerned by the appeal, \\neven armed groups \"provided they put down their weapons,\" Mr. \\nNahnah indicated. \\n  \"We want the TADJ to bring together all the ulemas, the \\npreachers, the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], whether dissolved \\nor not, En-Nahda [Awakening], the El Oumma (editor\\'s note: \\nleague headed by Benyoucef Benkhedda), etc. \\n  \"All upright nationalists and all the Algerians who want to \\nbar the way to those who cause trouble and divisions,\" he added. \\n  At the close of the conference, Sheik Abou-Djara Soltani, \\nprofessor at the Constantine Islamic University and conference \\nspokesman, made it a point to clarify some issues raised by the \\norganization of such a meeting. \\n  Answering a question concerning the similarity [of the RIR] \\nwith Mr. Said Sadi\\'s MPR [Movement for the Republic], Mr. \\nSoltani bluntly stated that the RIR does not aspire \"to any \\ncomplementarity or normalization between Islamism and \\nsecularism\"; the speaker even went so far as to state that the \\nmovement he is calling for \"would oppose the MPR.\" \\n  To those who wonder whether the time was well chosen to hold \\nsuch a conference and create the RIR, Mr. Soltani said that the \\nRIR does not claim to be a political formation and \"has no \\nambition to take a direct part in the National Conference,\" \\nalthough he did not rule out the possibility that the RIR might \\nact as a mediator between the FIS and the government, should it \\nbe asked to do so. \\n  In answering all these questions, Mr. Soltani insisted on \\nthe \\nnonpartisan nature of his movement which, he said, will strive \\nto fulfill the function which was initially assigned to the \\nDawla Islamiya [Islamic State] league but which the league could \\nnot fulfill \"for reasons beyond its control or reasons of its \\nown.\" At the end of his conference, Mr. Soltani announced a \\nforthcoming RIR conference designed to examine questions \\nconcerning its organization and operation, and the eventual \\ncreation of a forum for reconciliation and the settlement of \\nconflicts. \\n\\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n920114\\n\\n\\nFT  14 JAN 92 / Moslem militants polarise Arab world: Fears over the spread\\nof fundamentalism\\n\\n\\nJUDGING by the wary reaction throughout the Arab world to events in Algeria,\\nArab leaders do not for one minute believe that attempts to deny Algeria's\\nIslamic party a ballot box victory will be the end of the story.\\nRather, concern over the spread of fundamentalism is almost palpable in Arab\\ncapitals, at a time when the Islamic tendency has been on the rise\\nregionally.\\nThe Algerian drama also coincides with deepening disillusionment with\\nautocratic regimes across the region, fuelled partly by economic distress.\\nMilitant Islam, while most conspicuous, is by no means alone in its\\nopposition to the established order.\\nConcern will be greatest among Algeria's Maghreb neighbours - Tunisia and\\nMorocco. Tunisian leaders, who crushed the local Nadha (Renaissance)\\nfundamentalist party after concluding several years ago that dialogue would\\nserve no useful purpose, had been most openly fearful that free elections in\\nAlgeria would bring the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to power.\\nTunisian newspapers, predictably, have voiced relief over the steps to deny\\nAlgeria's fundamentalists control of parliament. The independent daily,\\nAssabah, yesterday compared developments 'to a last-minute change of\\ndirection by a train heading towards the abyss'.\\nKing Hassan of Morocco, who has kept silent in the face of disturbing events\\nacross the border, is certain to be relieved that the fundamentalists have\\nbeen stopped, if only momentarily, although he cannot be particularly\\nsanguine about the future. Morocco banned an incipient fundamentalist\\nmovement in January 1990, but Islamic militancy will almost certainly\\ncontinue in an autocratically governed country burdened by economic\\ndeprivation.\\nIn Egypt, where there is persistent tension between the authorities and\\nIslamic militants, the interior minister warned just hours after President\\nChadli Bendjedid's resignation that the security forces would not tolerate\\nany attempt to sow instability.\\n'Our commitment to democracy does not limit our movement to confront\\nimmediately any attempt to break the law or destabilise security, whether by\\nreligious extremists or others,' Mr Abdel-halim Moussa told a parliamentary\\ncommittee. Egypt's banned but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood had cheered the\\nFIS's first ballot triumph as an inspiration for the religious across the\\nregion.\\nMr Mohammed Hamed Abul-Nasr, the Brotherhood's spiritual guide, wrote to the\\nFIS: 'I pray God to grant you a complete and sweeping victory in the final\\nstage and that all Moslems will stand united so that there is no weakness\\nfor Satan to exploit.'\\nSaudi Arabia has remained silent on developments in Algeria, but its rulers\\n -under pressure from extremists  - are likely to be quietly relieved that\\nthe FIS has been denied control for the time being.\\nThe Saudis have been grappling with a resurgence of Moslem militancy among\\ntheir subjects, a challenge which has provoked unusually forthright\\ncriticism from a member of the royal family and from the country's spiritual\\nleader.\\nIn statements widely quoted in December in the Saudi press, Sheikh Abdel\\nAziz Ben Baz, the country's spiritual leader, condemned as a 'conspiracy'\\nagainst Islam a campaign by militants to undermine the authority of the\\nruling family.\\nExtremists have attacked Saudi rulers for alleged personal excesses, for\\ntheir attempts to modernise the state by allowing a greater role for women,\\nand for their support of the US-sponsored Middle East peace process.\\nPrince Turki al-Faisal, son of the late king and head of the Saudi\\nintelligence services, expressed the ruling family's concerns in a speech at\\na Riyadh mosque last month attacking the underground campaign being waged by\\nSaudi militants.\\nEgyptian and Saudi leaders have also been looking askance at developments in\\nSudan, where General Omar al Bashir's ruling junta is widely regarded to be\\nin the thrall of the powerful National Islamic Front (NIF), headed by the\\ncharismatic Dr Hassan al-Turabi.\\nThe recent visit to Khartoum of Iran's President Ali Akbar Hashemi\\nRafsanjani and reports that Tehran was supplying Sudan with military\\ntraining and equipment was enough to generate heated criticism in Cairo's\\nofficial press.\\nMr Ibrahim Nafeh, editor-in-chief of the Cairo daily newspaper, Al Ahram,\\nand a confidante of President Hosni Mubarak, attacked Sudan's alliance with\\nIran. 'God help the brotherly Sudanese people,' he wrote. 'For years, the\\nsituation in Sudan has been deteriorating with governments changing hands\\nconsecutively until Gen Al Bashir rose to power in a military coup d'etat\\nand overshadowed all previous leaders in his blunt efforts to push Sudan\\ndown the drain.'\\nThere is little doubt that in both Algeria and in the wider Arab world, the\\nbattle between the secularists and Islamic militants has been joined.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

The clever rulers -- if they do exist -- must \\nnot uselessly burden the nation with conflicts and shocks. \\nWhile Turkey seeks to include the Islamic movement in its \\ndemocratic process, the very clever rulers of Egypt still think \\nthat they can liquidate the Islamic movement, thus making us \\nsuffer from internal attrition for a while longer and making \\nsure that Islamic victory is born only through pain, suffering, \\nand bleeding.\" \\n  CHIEF EDITOR NOTES DESTRUCTION OF LIBERTIES \\n  Page 2 also features a 1,000-word article by Chief Editor \\nMajdi Ahmad Husayn in which he draws attention to the erosion of \\nthe democratic system in Egypt. He notes that at the beginning \\nof \"our lame democratic experiment\" the regime applied democracy \\nlittle-by-little because the Egyptian people were not advanced \\nand could not adapt to democracy all at once, the situation has \\nworsened since the president\\'s third term. The regime has moved \\nto \"exclude liberties from the democratic system \\nlittle-by-little.\" The writer also criticizes the government\\'s \\nmishandling of the case of the millionaire Ishaq Hakim who \\nswindled the banks and individuals of tens of millions of pounds. \\n  LAWYERS MODERATION, NATIONAL UNITY UNDERLINED \\n  A 1,500-word article by Qutb al-\\'Arabi on page 3 discusses \\nthe lawyers\\' crisis. The writer says that despite the heated \\ndebate that took place during the meeting of the general lawyers \\nsyndicate council and the branch syndicates last Wednesday \\nevening, the final resolutions were moderate, aimed at finding a \\n\"peaceful solution to the crisis.\" The resolutions called for \\nsending a letter in the name of the branch syndicates to the \\npresident of the republic and forming a delegation of the \\nsyndicate council to meet with the prime minister to demand an \\nimmediate investigation of the death of lawyer \\'Abd-al-Harith \\nMadani and the quick release of the detainees. \\n  The writer adds that while the lawyers syndicate displayed a \\nmeasure of flexibility in dealing with the crisis and gave the \\ngovernment a chance to solve the crisis peacefully, the \\ngovernment did not show any flexibility and escalated its \\nmeasures against the lawyers by continuing to detain the \\nlawyers\\' leaders, including some members of the syndicate \\ncouncil, and maintaining the media campaign against the \\nsyndicate. \\n  A 500-word unattributed article on the same page notes that \\nthe lawyers\\' crisis has enhanced national unity among the \\nlawyers. The article says \"the recent lawyers\\' syndicate crisis \\nhas highlighted the genuine unity among the lawyers, despite \\ndifferences in their political and religious affiliations.\" \\nDuring the lawyers demonstration, Sayf-al-Islam al-Banna \\n(Muslim Brotherhood) stood next to the Nasirist Samih \\'Ashur, \\nthe Wafdist \\'Abd-al-Halim Mandhur, and the communist Nabil \\nal-Hilali. Three Copts were among the lawyers and citizens \\narrested by the police. Coptic lawyers also took part in \\ndefending their arrested brothers. \\n  WRITER VIEWS MIDDLE EASTERN MARKET FROM ISLAMIC STANDPOINT \\n  AL-SHA\\'B publishes an 500-word article by Dr. Husayn \\nShahatah \\non page 5 in which he views the proposed Middle Eastern common \\nmarket from an Islamic economic standpoint. He notes that the \\npurpose of the Islamic economy is to develop the land to achieve \\na good and dignified life for the people to worship to God. \\nEconomy in Islam is linked to moral and religious values. God \\nhas prohibited monopoly, fraud, and exploitation. But, the \\nwriter continues, the proposed Middle Eastern market will not be \\nlike that. It will be a crusader, Zionist market dominated by \\nthe Jews. \"A study and analysis of everything that has been \\npublished about the purpose and objectives of this market \\nreveals that the aim is to control the resources of the Arab \\nIslamic nation and bring it under the hegemony of the Jews \\n(Israel), the United States, and the West.\" This is economic \\nexploitation. They want to subordinate the Arab Islamic states \\nto non-Muslims to \"control their political, educational, social, \\nand economic decisions.\" \\n  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE PREACHES ISLAMIC VALUES \\n  Muslim Brotherhood Deputy Guide Mustafa Mashhur publishes an \\n1,800 word article on page 5 in which he attempts to promote \\nIslam. He begins by citing passages from a book by Imam \\nal-Banna, founder of the Islamic Brotherhood movement, entitled \\n\"The Brothers Under the Banner of the Koran,\" in which he \\nexplains the purity, honesty, and universality of the Islamic \\nfaith. Mashhur notes that the prophet began his mission alone. \\nHe faced great difficulties. But God\\'s light descended on him \\nand dispelled the darkness of ignorance within a few years, \\nclearing the Arabian Peninsula of idols and infidels. \\n  He then explains how the invasion of materialistic cultures \\nleft their effect on the Islamic countries, prompting the \\nMuslims to deviate from the essence of their religion. He \\nquotes the following passage from Imam al-Banna\\'s book: \"Our \\nduty is to face this wave of materialistic culture until it \\nrecedes and our nation becomes free of its afflictions. We must \\nnot stop there, but pursue it in its own country until the \\nentire world shouts the name of the prophet, may God\\'s prayers \\nand peace be upon him, and the canopy of Islam spread over the \\nearth.\" \\n  Mashhur adds: \"All Muslims have a responsibility before God \\nto spread this true religion and to save humanity from the \\ndarkness of materialism, its tyranny and oppression, and to \\nbring humanity to the light of Islam, its justice, security, and \\npeace.\" Islam, he says, is a complete and comprehensive \\nreligion, because it is from God, who is complete. \\n  Mashhur then moves on to refute the claim of some \"defeated \\nwriters that the Islamists want to establish a religious \\ngovernment with divine authority as in the middle ages. He also \\nrefutes the claim that the Islamists are \"seeking to overthrow \\nthe present regime.\" He says this is a false claim, refuted by \\nreality and facts. \"We believe in pluralism and democracy that \\nadheres to the teachings of Islam, which is the official \\nreligion of the state. We do not believe in violence or \\nanything of that sort. We do not seek power for ourselves.\" \\nThose who work for Islam, he concludes, will not relax or \\nweaken as their reward will be with God. \\n  COLUMNIST HIGHLIGHTS SITUATION OF MUSLIMS IN AFRICA \\n  In his 200-word regular column \"This is Our Religion\" on \\npage \\n12, Muhammad al-Ghazali brings attention to the situation of the \\nMuslims in Africa. He notes how European colonialism \\npartitioned Africa in such a way as to deprive the Muslims of an \\nindependent state. He concludes that the \"Muslims south of \\nEgypt and Sudan, and around the Horn of Africa are facing strife \\nand loss. Plans are being implemented to liquidate them and \\ntheir religion. Zionism and the crusaders are behind this new \\noffensive. An unjust and treacherous threat is facing the \\nMuslims in this area, and those of us in the Nile Valley and the \\nArabian Peninsula must be aware of what is happening and probe \\nits dimensions. If it does not hit us today, it will not miss \\nus tomorrow.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Meanwhile, a prominent \\nIranian opposition leader has revealed that \"new forces and a \\npopular movement in the country are prepared to surge forward to \\nend the repressive dictatorship and replace it with a democratic \\nregime capable of saving Iran from catastrophe.\" \\n  Tens of thousands of people poured onto Tehran\\'s streets in \\nthe direction of the great Freedom Square carrying placards \\nproclaiming \"No Settlement With Enemies of Revolution,\" and \\nshouting such slogans as \"Death to America\" and \"Death to \\nIsrael.\" [passage omitted] \\n  In an exclusive interview with AL-HAYAH from Tehran, Daryush \\nForuhar (65 years old), leader of the Nation of Iran Party (the \\noldest secular organization in the country), painted a gloomy \\npicture of the economic, political, and social situation.

It received a substantial\\nboost from the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) victory in Algeria - the more\\nso since the military-backed cancellation of Algeria's second round poll is\\nwidely felt to have eroded the credibility of Arab leaders' attempts to\\nintroduce democracy.\\nAlgeria and Jordan cannot be directly compared, however, and some analysts\\nargue that Amman's system has enough safety valves to prevent outright\\nconfrontation between the Brotherhood and King Hussein.\\nWhile the FIS emerged in the 1980s as an alternative movement to the ruling\\nNational Liberation Front in Algeria, for instance, Jordan's King always\\nallowed the Brotherhood a special status for having supported him during the\\n1950s against Arab left-wingers and radicals.\\nMoreover, the Brotherhood's leaders have constantly sought to avoid\\nconfrontation with the state and have opted in the past to use its\\nprivileged status to take influential positions in government institutions.\\nHowever, relations between the palace and the Brotherhood have grown\\nincreasingly strained over the past few years as King Hussein has publicly\\nattacked the movement's efforts to change the country's relatively liberal\\nlifestyle. The Brotherhood has found itself further alienated from the King\\nsince his reconciliation with former radical opponents and his decision to\\nenter peace talks with Israel last October.\\nAccording to some members of the Brotherhood, the movement's most prominent\\nleaders are concerned to retain a conciliatory policy towards the King. But\\nthey are coming under pressure from an increasingly militant power base.\\nIn response to events in Algeria, the Brotherhood has found room within\\nitself for both radical and moderating voices. The movement has attacked the\\ncancellation of elections in Algeria as 'usurpation of power from\\nIslamicists', though some officials from the movement have also criticised\\nFIS for 'confrontational tactics'.\\nFor its part, the palace remains wary about the movement's declared aim of\\nestablishing an Islamic state in Jordan, despite the fact that more radical\\nmembers of the Brotherhood criticise its leaders for 'co-option' into the\\nstate.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n\\nLanguage:  Arabic \\nArticle Type:CSO \\n\\n [Article by Muhammad al-Ashhab in Rabat] \\n  [Text] A call from Moroccan opposition parties to end the \\nhouse arrest of Shaykh Abdessalem Yacine has raised questions \\nabout the kind of relationship anticipated between these parties \\nand Islamic groups in Morocco. \\n  With the exception of the traditionally-inclined Istiqlal \\n[Independence] Party, which has previously called for the \\nabsorption of these groups, the other opposition parties, \\nespecially the Socialist Union and Democratic Action, have \\nviewed with discomfort the growth of the role of the Islamic \\ngroups. Their political bases in Moroccan universities, \\nespecially in Fes and Casablanca, have clashed with Islamic \\nmovements, while the Party of Progress and Socialism (formerly \\nthe Communist Party) has not ceased calling for resistance to \\nthese groups, which had virtually overwhelmed Morocco's \\nuniversities, in return for a drop in the influence of the \\ntraditional parties. Its leader, Ali Yata, brought up this \\nquestion in political and official meetings, demanding an end to \\nthe exploitation of the universities by extremist Islamic \\ngroups. The same is the case with the imams of some mosques, who \\noppose the existence of a communist party in the country. \\n  While the opposition parties' campaign in defense of Shaykh \\nYacine is part of the process of bringing up the problem of \\nhuman rights conditions in the country, and to obtain the \\npolitical and financial support from these groups in support of \\nopposition aims, it is noteworthy that some political parties \\nhave recently raised the issue of working together with the \\nIslamic groups. Their condition is a commitment to a political \\nplan based upon legality. According to opposition politicians, \\nthere are dozens of Islamic organizations in Morocco at work \\nraising religious awareness. Some of them bear a political \\nstamp, which imposes a formula for dealing with them, \\nparticularly as the Islamic groups have shown their presence in \\nthe large demonstrations held during the Gulf crisis and in \\nlabor holiday festivities. \\n  The Socialist Union's acting leader, Mohamed Yazghi, said \\nthat these groups had voted for the opposition parties in the \\nrecent legislative elections in major cities such as Rabat, \\nSali, and Fes. Lawyers affiliated with opposition activities \\nhave defended members belonging to the Justice and Charity \\nSociety led by Shaykh Yacine in several trials in 1990. This was \\nnot the case in the 1984 trials, when a plan to disturb the \\ncountry's security, led by extremist groups linked with foreign \\nparties, was uncovered. \\n  In this context it may be mentioned that the Moroccan \\nGovernment is formulating a plan for confronting the extremist \\nIslamic groups, typified by its ban on mosques engaging in \\npolitical activity. It has stopped the imams of some mosques who \\nhad been engaging in these activities. The Ministry of Islamic \\nAffairs undertook the opening of a dialogue with the Islamic \\ngroups committed to admonition and guidance rather than forcing \\nthemselves into political controversy. It is noteworthy that the \\nleaders of Islamic movements in several Arab and Islamic \\nmovements participated in demonstrations held in Casablanca as \\npart of what was known as the Islamic Awakening Community. It \\nhas been decided that Morocco will, in the coming weeks, host a \\nconference of ministers of Islamic affairs from the Arab and \\nIslamic worlds, to discuss the idea of coexistence and \\nreconciliation among Islamic sects. \\n  The Islamic Awakening Community will focus, in a conference \\nto be held this month, on studying this question and other \\nrelated problems, in cooperation with Islamic groups. \\n  Concerned persons believe that the call of the opposition \\nparties, whose agendas diverge from the direction of the Islamic \\nparties, has to do with putting political pressure on the \\ngovernment, by putting thorny problems before the \\nrecently-created Ministry of Human Rights. The least of these \\nwould be the studying of the conditions of detainees belonging \\nto Islamic groups, and urging international organizations to \\nshow renewed concern for the state of human rights. \\n  Those who follow these developments say that the political \\ngoal in raising this issue appears obviously through their \\npresentation in Parliament, where it was possible for the \\nConsultative Council on Human Rights, concerned with the defense \\nof human rights, to study it. Opposition party circles \\nthemselves do not hide their discomfort at this trend, which \\ncould backfire on the opposition itself, as the affiliates of \\nthe Islamic groups mistrust the role of the traditional parties, \\nand go farther than they do in the field of implementing Islamic \\nlaw.

            "{'text': '\\n\\nLanguage:  Persian \\nArticle Type:CSO \\n\\n  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. On \\nthe occasion of the beginning of the 16th anniversary of the \\ntriumph of the Islamic revolution and the arrival of the blessed \\nTen Days Dawn Celebration, five Majles deputies answered three \\nquestions from RESALAT. With thanks to Hojjat ol-Eslam Baghani, \\ndeputy from Sabzevar and chief of the Legislative and Judicial \\nAffairs Commission, Dr. \\'Abdkhoda\\'i, deputy from Mashhad and \\nchief of the Culture and Higher Education Commission, Seyyed \\nReza Taqavi, deputy from Tehran and chief of the Guidance and \\nIslamic Art Commission, Engineer Mohsen Yahyavi, deputy from \\nTehran and chief of the Oil Commission and Mohsen Kuhkan, deputy \\nfrom Lanjan, we direct your attention to the questions and \\nanswers. \\n  Three Questions From RESALAT to Majles Deputies \\n  1. What are the best gains of the revolution? \\n  2. What are the shortcomings of the revolution? \\n  3. What is the most important duty of the officials and the \\npeople to preserve and continue the revolution? \\n  Answer From Mr. Taqavi, Deputy From Tehran \\n  Public participation in the affairs of the revolution is one \\nof the important achievements of this revolution. \\n  In answer to the first question he said: As the greatest \\nevent of the century, the Islamic revolution has affected the \\nworld in various ways. Today the international societies and \\nworld policy planners cannot ignore this great intellectual and \\nrevolutionary wave in their projects and decisions, because in \\nthe world\\'s political geography the Islamic revolution of Iran \\nhas achieved its high position and no power has the ability to \\neliminate it. The world that opposes this revolution\\'s \\naspirations has spared nothing in its enmity, its rancor, its \\nbrutality and its attempts to overthrow this change, from the \\neconomic embargo to domestic assassinations, the imposed war and \\nother plots. One of the wonders of the Islamic revolution is \\nthat it has resisted proudly and has continued to make its way \\nthrough these obstacles. \\n  One of the Islamic revolution\\'s most important successes is \\nthat it has been able to awaken the light of awareness and \\nwakefulness in the hearts and minds of a great mass of the \\nworld\\'s oppressed and deprived people. It has created an \\nintellectual and cultural wave concerning the place of religion \\nand religious practice. In a world of polytheism and lust, this \\nis a great achievement this revolution has made. Today this \\nrevolution inspires religious crusading and struggle for the \\ndeprived people of Lebanon, the oppressed people of Palestine, \\nthe heros of Algeria and the upright people of Bosnia and \\nHerzegovina, and they have risen to fight and wage religious war \\nrelying on this idea. It is not without reason that the \\nimperialists and idolaters of our age are very afraid of this \\nwave of awakening in the nations that adhere to Islam. [passage \\nomitted discussing the accomplishments of the revolution in \\ngeneral terms] \\n  1. A dangerous disease in the revolution is reactionary \\nthought, which is besetting it like a plague; it will soon have \\nthe ability to convert any proud movement to silence or \\nwithdrawal. Reactionaries, with their deceptive and apparently \\nconcerned appearance, initially attract to themselves the naive \\nand fearful, those with little substance and a superficial view, \\nand they make them pessimistic about the changes of the \\nrevolution. They gradually make the people lose enthusiasm about \\nthe affairs of the revolution and bring the revolution up \\nagainst problems. It appears to be a simple thing to deal with \\nthese people, who have a handsome exterior, because the Noble \\nProphet (peace be upon him) said: \"Two groups have broken my \\nback, the reckless world and the ignorant recluse.\" \\n  2. Another disease in the revolution is \"extremist \\nrevisionism.\" This group, like the reactionaries, is also \\ndestructive. They distort the principles and fundamentals of the \\nrevolution with inappropriate and unacceptable analyses, and \\nthey draw the revolution into deviation by using the appeals of \\nrenewal and the inner tendency of human beings towards diversity. \\n  3. Another disease in the revolution is that its aspirations \\nand programs do not go beyond slogans and talk. To get more \\npublic support and to create conditions for its export, every \\nrevolution must get beyond slogans and into action as quickly as \\npossible, and it must solve the problems of life to an \\nacceptable extent. A revolution that is unable to correct \\nmalfunctions will not succeed. \\n  An important mission for every revolution is to set models \\nin \\nvarious sectors. A good model is the best and most evocative \\nevidence of a revolution\\'s capability. The model is the precise \\naction and physical manifestation of slogans and aspirations. \\nTherefore, one of the important shortcomings of the slogan is \\nthe nonconformity of action to words. \\n  1 [as published] - Another disease in the revolution is \\ndisputes and alienation among the revolutionary forces. \\nOpportunists and flatterers benefit greatly wherever these \\ndisputes exist. They have gained a foothold for themselves \\ninside the structure of the government by making use of the \\natmosphere of conflict, and they have made the revolution \\ndeviate with their explanations and justifications. \\n  Mr. Taqavi Said in Answer to the Third Question [sentence as \\npublished] \\n  Officials must serve, and they must work sincerely and set \\ntheir hearts on solving the problems of the people, and the \\npeople must also support the officials in view of the criteria \\nmentioned. \\n  The officials and the people must keep the revolution\\'s \\ndeprived in mind in whatever they do, and they must act in the \\nframework of guidance, aspirations, explanations and sacred \\nideals. \\n  In the Islamic revolution this framework is the imamate and \\nthe concept of the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult. The \\nchief jurisconsult is a person who is fully qualified in terms \\nof theological knowledge and whose actions are effective and \\njust. The people and the officials must make the chief \\njurisconsult their standard for truth and falshood and justice \\nand oppression, just as has been done so far, to guarantee the \\nrevolution\\'s continuation. \\n  Full public supervision of official activities will mean \\nthat \\nwork will be done on the straight path of the Islamic revolution \\nand with greater soundness, and weakness and deviation will be \\nreduced. Consequently positive effects such as growth in public \\nconfidence will occur, and following that, the desire and \\nenthusiasm for support will reach a peak. \\n  For the revolution to continue, the people and the officials \\nmust think beyond themselves and their personal and class \\ninterests. They must think of the revolution and its Islamic and \\nhuman aspirations. They must put the needs of the revolution \\nahead of their own needs for the revolution to continue. \\n  Answer From Dr. \\'Abdkhoda\\'i, Deputy From Mashhad \\n  The more our country leans toward consumerism, the more \\ndependent it will be, and with dependence the foundations of the \\nrevolution are shaken. \\n  In answer to the first question, Dr. \\'Abd Khoda\\'i said: \\n  The Islamic revolution was a bright star shining on the \\nworld\\'s dark horizon. It made Muslims aware of their Islamic \\nessence. This must be considered the revolution\\'s most important \\nachievement. Before the triumph of the Islamic revolution the \\nworld was ruled by the Eastern and Western blocs. They made \\nplans in any way they wished for the weak people and the Third \\nWorld. One billion Muslims had no identity. The leaders of the \\nIslamic nations were dependent on the West or on the East, and \\nwhat was not a factor in the world of politics was Islam and its \\naspirations. \\n  With the emergence of the Islamic revolution, the people \\nunderstood their orthodox authenticity. The Muslim people of \\nAlgeria, who had been put down by hand-picked imperialist \\nagents, proved to the world that love for Islam burns in the \\ndepths of their souls. Although the brave Muslims of Egypt are \\nin prison, instead of \"glory to the Arabs\" the cry \"glory to \\nGod, his prophet and to the believers\" is ringing in their \\nhearts. Although the Muslim people of Bosnia spend the dark \\nnights under savage Serb bombardment, the heartening cry of \\n\"there is not god but God\" rises to the sky from their minarets. \\nIn short, a great many of the world\\'s Muslims have returned to \\nthemselves and have understood their Islamic essence. This in \\nitself is the beginning of a great world change with regard to \\nIslam. Today many intellectuals admit that Islam is the source \\nof the greatest world changes, a change that fills the hearts of \\nthe world\\'s deprived people and has shaken world imperialism. \\n  Before the triumph of the Islamic revolution in our country, \\na few educated people under the influence of Marx and Mao said \\nthat their ideas were liberating and progressive, and some \\npeople also thought progress and advancement in the country \\ndepended on putting religion and religious practice aside and \\ntraveling the road taken by the Western nations. Before the \\nrevolution art, television and movies portrayed the ugliest \\nfilms. There were shameful images on the streets of Tehran and \\nmany other cities that modesty of expression and writing would \\nnever have permitted. In a nation whose foundation was Islam and \\nShi\\'ism, millions of people were disgusted, and their disgust \\nwas imprisoned in their breasts. \\n  The greatest fruit of the revolution was that it made the \\nworld of Islam and the Muslims aware of their Islamic identity. \\nAlthough we have not yet fully achieved Islamic goals, we have \\nfound salvation from the failed situation of the past. \\n  He said another achievement of the Islamic revolution was \\npolitical independence. He said: Our country was under the \\ndomination of foreign governments for years. Since the time of \\nthe Qajars our country was the center of attacks and invasions \\nby Russia and the English, so that at the time the interests of \\nEngland and America were achieved, the most humiliating things \\nwere imposed on our nation such as the capitulation, but in the \\nIslamic Republic the officials have risen from among the nation \\nand are not dominated by foreigners. \\n  Inside the monarchy most officials spent the evenings at \\nfancy gatherings, but in the Islamic Republic a group of \\nofficials spends the evenings in prayer. At that time officials \\nwent to work with their thinking clouded by the effects of \\nalcohol, but in the Islamic Republic of Iran they think for the \\npeople with the Imam\\'s ideas taken from the Koran and the Nahj \\nol-Balagheh. \\n  Our dear people must realize that our three government \\npowers \\nmake their decisions independently and there is no type of \\nforeign dominion over them. This is the greatest source of pride. \\n  In this connection a point that must be noted is the role of \\nthe position of the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and \\nthe leadership. In recent years as changes have occurred with \\nour neighbor to the north, meaning the Soviet Union, they have \\nsuffered impotence-causing domestic wars because of not having \\nproper leadership, and there have been continuous problems for \\nthem. \\n  The people must never forget the role of orthodox faith and \\nleadership. Our nation, taking inspiration from the exalted \\northodoxy of Islam and the principle of the vice-regency of the \\nchief jurisconsult, has overcome the difficult conditions of the \\nperiod of the revolution and is now moving with political \\nstability and national harmony along the path of reconstruction. \\n  One of the blessed effects of the Islamic revolution is the \\nnation\\'s growth and development. The valuable services the \\nIslamic Republic gives to the deprived and remote areas cannot \\nbe compared to what was happening before the revolution. Before \\nthe revolution there were 160,000 university students. Today \\nthis number has risen to 900,000. The literacy crusade has had \\noutstanding success in making many people literate who could not \\nread or write. Before the triumph of the revolution Muslim women \\nhad to see male physicians for simple surgery and to give birth, \\nbut the number of female physicians has now increased \\nsignificantly. The infant mortality rate has dropped \\nsignificantly since the time before the revolution, in such a \\nway that Iran has been praised by the WHO. \\n  In the years after the triumph of the revolution thousands \\nof \\nkilometers of rural roads and several thousand schools and \\nhealth clinics were built throughout the country, and thousands \\nof villages were afforded the blessings of electrical power and \\nhealthy drinking water. Although the country was caught up in \\nthe imposed war for eight years, overall it has had outstanding \\ngrowth and tens of thousands of development, industrial and \\nservice projects have been created in the country. \\n  Of course, the people must take note of the basic point that \\nunder the regime of the idolaters world conditions for buying \\noil were better than they are today, and every barrel of oil \\nsold for $36, in some years oil revenues were more than $24 \\nbillion and the nation\\'s population was about 30 million. In \\nrecent years, however, the price of oil has gone as low as about \\n$10 and the nation\\'s population has reached about 60 million. \\n  In the past, however, except in a few cases infrastructure \\nwork was not done. Even though the country was sitting on a sea \\nof oil and gas, petrochemical products were imported. Those \\naffiliated with the royal court plundered the nation\\'s revenues \\nand put it in their accounts outside the country. They made \\nthousands of home and real estate purchases abroad and spent the \\nmoney on their own entertainment. Today, however, with less \\nrevenue than was available at that time and despite the losses \\ncaused by the war, the nation is moving in the direction of \\nreconstruction and self-sufficiency. Of course, I am not denying \\nthe existence of problems in the country. We have problems with \\neducation, the economy and inflation. \\n  The deputy from Mashhad then said in answer to the second \\nquestion: One of the diseases of the revolution is the \\nweakening of the aspirations of the revolution. If we are \\nindifferent to the aspirations of Islam, it will be the greatest \\naffliction for the revolution. The problem of the cultural \\ninvasion that is being imposed on the country by foreigners is \\none of the revolution\\'s most important afflictions, which is \\nsometimes direct and sometimes indirect. This can take the form \\nof films, videotapes, or propaganda in the area of ostentation \\nand consumerism. The more our country leans toward consumerism, \\nthe more dependent it will be, and with dependence the \\nfoundations of the revolution are shaken. At the present time \\nour country has political independence. We must therefore strive \\nto achieve economic independence as well. We will be independent \\neconomically when we decrease consumption and increase \\nproduction. \\n  One problem that could afflict the revolution is high prices \\nand inflation, especially in the area of public needs. If the \\npeople see that they are having a hard time managing their \\nlives, they may become indifferent. The greatest task before the \\ngovernment and the Majles is to anchor inflation. In this regard \\nattention must be given to the differences between incomes. If \\nthe income gap becomes too great, some people will be engulfed \\nin materialism and others were be under such severe pressure \\nthat life will be like a dark night for them. \\n  Continuing, Dr. \\'Abdkhoda\\'i mentioned dependence on the \\noutside world and borrowing as other problems for the revolution. \\n  He also answered the third question as follows: One must \\nnote \\ninitially that the people and the officials in the Islamic \\nRepublic are brothers, and the officials have come from the \\npeople. The commander of the faithful (peace be upon him) gave \\nimportant commands in his 216th sermon concerning relations \\nbetween the people and the officials. \\n  In this sermon His Holiness said: The condition of a nation \\nwill not be good unless it has good leaders, and the leaders \\ncannot do good work unless the people are firm and steadfast. \\n  In the first place those running the country must be sound \\nand they must feel that they are indebted to the people. They \\nare responsible before the blood of thousands of martyrs who \\ngave their lives during the revolution. Most important of all, \\nwe are responsible to a glorious Shi\\'ite history, which has \\nalways suffered throughout 14 centuries but has never given up \\nits high goals. In the Islamic Republic time must not be a \\nconsideration for officials. They must serve the people to the \\nbest of their ability. On the other hand the people must also \\nhave a sense of responsibility. They must realize the conditions \\nwe are in and realize that we are in a situation where world \\nimperialism is united against Islam, religion, orthodoxy, and \\nour high Islamic aspirations and it creates a new problem for us \\nevery day. In such a situation each person in the country must \\nlook for ways to serve the government. \\n  Answer From Mr. Yahyavi, Deputy From Tehran \\n  Seeking welfare, consumerism, and lack of concern for \\ncultural work along with the economic work is one of the \\nafflictions besetting the revolution. \\n  He said in answer to the first question: One of the very \\nimportant effects and great achievements of the Islamic \\nrevolution is its revelation of the unknown talents of the \\npeople. Taking inspiration from the life-giving commands of \\nIslam, following the leadership of His Holiness Imam Khomeyni \\nand giving up life and property, the Muslim nation of Iran \\nbrought the heavily armed idolater regime to its knees and \\nestablished the Islamic Republic. With confidence in the life \\nthe Islamic Republic created among the Muslims of the world, the \\npeople of Algeria and south Lebanon found the courage to fight \\ntheir enemies. I remember that during the pilgrimage to Mecca \\nwhen I met with African Muslims they said that our revolution \\ngave them heart, and the inclination towards Christianity became \\nan inclination towards Islam after the triumph of the Islamic \\nrevolution in Iran. \\n  One of the valued achievements of the Islamic revolution was \\ndealing with the deprived class and the nation\\'s remote rural \\nareas. There were 10 times more rural roads created than were \\ncreated in the time before the revolution, and many services \\nhave been rendered in the construction of classrooms and health \\nclinics. \\n  About five times as much university classroom space has been \\nbuilt as existed in the past, and we cannot stop developing \\nclassroom space as long as there is one student waiting to take \\nthe entrance examination. \\n  Concerning the second question, the deputy from Tehran \\nnoted: \\nThe greatest affliction threatening the revolution is seeking \\nwelfare, consumerism, and lack of concern for cultural work \\nalong with the economic work. Up until now, because of being \\npreoccupied with economic activities and the nation\\'s \\ninfrastructure, we have not done the kind of cultural work that \\nshould be done. We have not succeeded in teaching religious \\nbeliefs to the young generation in the way that is appropriate, \\nand this cultural weakness could make the enemy successful with \\nthe cultural invasion. If the officials make more effort to do \\ncultural work, the cultural invasion will have no effect. If the \\ninner faith of individuals is not reinforced, the goals of the \\nenemy\\'s cultural invasion will certainly be achieved. \\n  Another affliction threatening the revolution is the seeking \\nof welfare and the great inclination towards consumerism. \\nCurrently the prevailing attitude is to seek easy incomes \\nwithout effort. If someone wants to perform his responsibility \\nin society properly, his income should play some role in \\nproduction, and he should not be thinking about getting more \\nprivileges. \\n  In answer to the final question, Engineer Yahyavi said: The \\npeople have the responsibility to take part in various public \\naffairs with political awareness and vigilance. The people must \\nhave political awareness in various sectors, from the university \\nto the workplace. They must be able to analyze the issues and \\nproblems, and in my view an individual should have full \\nunderstanding of the world in which he lives. He must be \\nfamiliar with the various fronts and make decisions. In that way \\nhe will be able to take proper positions. A person should not \\nprevent the people from becoming familiar with political \\naffairs. If people have political awareness, they certainly will \\nnot be fooled by the enemy. Another responsibility of the people \\nis to supervise the issues properly and to make constructive \\ncriticism. No official is exempt from constructive criticism. \\nAll must accept criticism to correct their work. All people and \\nofficials on all sides must try to perform their \\nresponsibilities properly to please God. \\n  The responsibility of the officials to preserve the \\nrevolution is heavier than that of the people, and they must not \\nput personal and occupational interests ahead of the interests \\nof the people. Our people have done their duty in the best way \\nto create and maintain the revolution, and now it is the \\nresponsibility of the officials to make every effort to serve \\nthese people. \\n  It is the duty of officials to assign responsibilities to \\nworthy people by identifying worthy elements, and to apply \\nencouragement and punishment in the work in the assessment of \\nperformance. It is also the duty of officials to be a force for \\nunity and harmony among the people, and they must avoid creating \\nany kind of separation or alienation. They must use knowledge \\nand other resources with proper management to compensate for the \\nsacrifices of the people. \\n  Answer From Mr. Baghani, Deputy From Sabzevar \\n  One of the things afflicting the revolution is discord, and \\nif discord is created in the nation, the existence of the \\nrevolution will be endangered. \\n  Mr \\'Ali Asghar Baghani, deputy from Sabzevar, said in answer \\nto RESALAT\\'s first question: The most important achievement of \\nthe Islamic revolution is stabilizing the government of the \\nIslamic Republic, because at the beginning of the triumph of the \\nIslamic revolution problems were created in various ways for the \\nIslamic government by minigroups, liberals and people seeking \\npower. [passage omitted on the accomplishments of the revolution \\nin general terms] \\n  Answer From Mr. Kuhkan, Deputy From Lanjan \\n  One of the revolution\\'s most important achievements is \\nputting the nation on the path of God and achieving political \\nindependence. \\n  Mr. Mohsen Kuhkan, deputy from Lanjan, said in answer to the \\nfirst question: The Islamic revolution\\'s most important \\nachievement for the Muslim nation of Iran is putting it on the \\npath of God, because before the revolution the idolatrous \\ngovernment ruled every dimension of life and called upon the \\npeople to enjoin evil and prohibit good. Today the government \\nhas formed and is advancing based on enjoining good and \\nprohibiting evil. \\n  Another of the revolution\\'s achievements is political \\nindependence. Today we can claim that we are the world\\'s most \\nindependent nation in terms of political independence. Another \\nof the revolution\\'s successes is that despite all the problems \\nsuch as the economic embargo, the imposed war, and the damage \\ncaused by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, it \\nis using the nation\\'s economic resources for development and \\nprosperity and to provide the minimum services need by the \\nnation\\'s cities and rural areas.

It has said that \\nthe recognition of the enemy's different moves and the necessary \\npreparedness against them will ensure the perpetual movement of \\nthe revolution. \\n  The Militant Clergy Association, indicating that the nations \\nof the world are burning with the desire to enjoy living in the \\nfree atmosphere of the Islamic Republic, has described the \\npeople of Iran to be the freest people in the world and the \\nIslamic Republic as the most independent state. \\n  In another part of the statement, the propaganda of \\nforeigners about human rights in Iran is condemned. The best \\nevidence of the enemy's baseless propaganda is about human \\nrights violations in Iran. Combating oppression and injustice \\nhas been the prime purpose of our nation. \\n  The Militant Clergy Association, in another part of its \\nstatement, after having proclaimed its support for the \\ngovernment's economic programs, says that it is unfair to accuse \\nthe government of having followed a Westernized economic policy. \\nIt believes that the revolution in terms of the economy has been \\non a logical and desirable course \\n  Warning against excessive spending, the statement says that \\na \\nlife of opulence and luxury is a major plague to a revolutionary \\nmovement--particularly the Islamic revolution. The public and \\nofficials must know that an aristocratic and excessive style of \\nlife cannot be included in the dictionary of the revolution and \\nit is not compatible with the divine values of the revolution. \\n  The Militant Clergy Association adds that careful control \\nand \\nsupervision of the government's organizations by the \\nrevolutionary institutions is a most important necessity that \\nwill reduce at minimum any possible wrongdoing and trespassing \\nupon the commonwealth of Muslims (state treasury). \\n  At the end, the statement urges the evermore increasingly \\nglorious celebration of the Islamic Revolution anniversary on \\nthis holy day of Bahman 22 [11 February] with the wide \\nparticipation of the devout people of Iran to make America and \\nthe usurper Zionist regime tremble with fear. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Call to Revive Islamic rule \\n  2. Secularism Versus Islam \\n  3. Antinormalization Committee \\n  4. Roots of Jewish Thought Examined \\n  5. Anti-Sudan British Conspiracy \\n  CALL TO REVIVE ISLAMIC RULE \\n  The 17 March issue of AL-USRAH AL-\\'ARABIYAH devotes much of \\nits space to the struggle between secular and Islamic currents. \\n  A 5,000-word report by Hani al-Makkawi on page 3 speaks of \\nthe ills wrought by \"morbid secularism\". The article, which \\nbears the headline: \"What Has the World Gained by Drawing Away \\nFrom Islam? ... Destruction, Corruption, Humiliation, and the \\nNations\\' Inability To Feed Themselves\", addresses the following \\nquestion to a large number of Islamic figures and academics: \\n\"What have the Muslims lost or gained by adopting secular \\nmethods in various spheres?\" \\n  Among the answers cited is one by Dr. Fawzi Ta\\'il, who lists \\nthe ills resulting from the abandonment of Islam, including the \\nspread of AIDS, illegal drugs, weakened family ties, \\nunemployment, spiritual emptiness, the specter of trade wars, \\nand \"moral catastrophes in the scientific field such as organ \\ntransplants; genetic engineering; artificial insemination; the \\nright to end one\\'s life, which they call suicide; and the right \\nto get rid of a fetus, which they call abortion.\" \\n  Noting that \"60 percent of the world\\'s population are \\nidolaters\", Ta\\'il asks: \"If the West casts off its hostility to \\nIslam, it will benefit from this great message that brings \\nguidance to the people of the Earth.\" \\n  Dr. Salim Najm, chairman of the Egyptian Relief Committee \\nand \\ndeputy president of the Physicians Association, comments on the \\nIslamic countries \"disgraceful\" attitude on the issues of \\nBosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Kashmir, which, he says, would \\nbe different if Islam ruled the world. \\n  Islamic preacher Tal\\'at al-Shinnawi, from al-Daqahliyah \\nGovernorate, says that the Islamic world\\'s abandonment of \\nshari\\'ah has led to autocratic rule and produced a strong Israel. \\n  Dr. Jamal \\'Abd-al-Hadi, a professor of Islamic history, says \\nthat as a result of its alienation from its religion, the \\nIslamic world suffered \"an obliteration of Islamic identity \\nfollowing the collapse of the Caliphate [Ottoman Empire] and an \\nintellectual invasion via foreign educational curricula and \\nmedia, non-Islamic values, and foreign economic domination, \\nparticularly after the Gulf war.\" \\n  \\'Abd-al-Hadi continues that alienation from Islam also \\ncaused \\nthe loss of Jerusalem, the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque, the chaste \\nland of Palestine, and al-Andalus [Spain]. \\n  Dr. Mahmud Himayah, professor of comparative religion and \\nhead of Asyut University\\'s Islamic Studies Department, \\ncriticizes \"imported constitutions and laws,\" which fail to \\npunish \"immorality and corruption of the faith.\" He attacks \\nsecular writers who ridicule Islamic teachings and symbols. He \\nextols such figures as Shaykh [Muhammad] al-Ghazali, Shaykh \\n[Muhammad Mutawalli] al-Sha\\'rawi, and the Grand Imam of al-Azhar. \\n  Himayah continues: \"It is strange that when al-Azhar uses \\nits natural right to confiscate the garbage of human thought \\n[zibalat al-fikr al-bashari], the secularists and communists \\nraise a brouhaha about freedom of belief and thought. It \\nappears as if freedom of thought among these people means to \\nattack sanctities and ridicule Islam.\" \\n  Dr. \\'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji, a professor at Suez Canal \\nUniversity and secretary general of the Scientific Professions \\nAssociation, says that by drawing away from Islam, the Islamic \\nworld lost its respect. He adds: \"We have become the world\\'s \\nplaything. Muslim blood has become the cheapest blood. The \\nera\\'s major tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina is two years old now \\nbut the Islamic world remains complacent and unconcerned. The \\nEuropean-U.S. West is fighting them by giving political, media, \\nand diplomatic backing to their enemy. Russia and Greece are \\nsupplying the aggressors with soldiers and hardware. The \\ninternational organizations, in the absence of Islam, are even \\nworse.\" \\n  Dr. \\'Abdallah Hilal, a nuclear energy professor, contrasts \\nIsrael\\'s early acquisition of nuclear power with the Islamic \\nworld\\'s lack of success in this sphere, which he blames on \\ninter-Arab differences and foreign intervention. Commenting on \\nEgypt\\'s plans in this field, he says: \"When the Egyptian \\nNuclear Energy Authority was established to boost the economy by \\nproducing electricity and desalinating sea water, it had great \\nsuccess in its first years. It brought good repute to Egypt and \\nother Arab and Islamic countries. Its cadres of trainees began \\nto carry this knowledge to Arab, Islamic, and African states. \\nNuclear power plants were supposed to be built and feasibility \\nstudies began for eight such stations. However, Zionist-U.S. \\nconspiracies did not allow the project to be completed. As a \\nresult of Egypt\\'s links with the U.S., there were no Egyptian \\nsecrets. They let us make studies and plans, offer tenders, and \\nspend much money and efforts only to interfere at the last \\nmoment to wreck our plans by using the weapons of aid, the IMF, \\nand the World Bank. In addition, we were given frank \\ninstructions to abandon the project. As a result our trained \\ncadres emigrated.\" \\n  Shaykh al-Ghazali says that after the collapse of the \\ncaliphate, the Islamic world\\'s enemies multiplied and communists \\nand secularists became stronger. He remarks that alienation \\nfrom Islam has rendered the Muslims very weak and notes that if \\nthe Islamic nation realizes what its role should be and returns \\nto its God and shari\\'ah, it will be \"qualified to lead the \\nworld.\" \\n\\n    SECULARISM VERSUS ISLAM \\n  Under the headline \"The Atheistic-Secularist Onslaught on \\nIslam: Its Causes and Motives,\" Dr. Ahmad al-Majdub, in a \\n2,000-word column on page 2, brands Egyptian communists as \\nselfish and superficial opportunists who, having lost their \\nerstwhile Soviet master, are now attacking Islam and Muslims in \\norder to demonstrate their credentials to the \"rich new U.S. \\nmaster.\" He notes that some of them are afraid of \"transferring \\ntheir loyalty directly to the West\" in order not to expose their \\ntrue opportunist nature. The column also defends Arab Muslims \\nwho helped the Afghans against the Soviet invaders, noting that \\nmost of them are not terrorists or extremists. \\n  ANTINORMALIZATION COMMITTEE \\n  A brief report by Hani al-Makkawi on page one discusses a \\nconference organized by the Cairo University Faculty Club, which \\nissued a statement announcing its determination to form a \\n\"committee for boycotting normalization with the Zionist enemy \\nin all spheres of life.\" The conference appealed to every \\nEgyptian who has any information on individuals and companies \\ndealing with the \"Zionist enemy\" to submit it to the above \\ncommittee. \\n  In a related item by al-Makkawi, a 3,000-word report on page \\n4 recounts protests against the Hebron massacre carried out by \\nstudents and faculty members at several Egyptian universities. \\n  ROOTS OF JEWISH THOUGHT EXAMINED \\n  A 2,000-word back-page article on page 10 offers an analysis \\nof the \"doctrinal and cultural roots\" that made a \"Zionist army \\nphysician take the liberty of assassinating hundreds of \\nPalestinians,\" a reference to the shooting of Muslim worshipers \\nin Hebron. \\n  The writer, Dr. Ahmad \\'Abd-al-Rahman, says the Talmud \\nteaches \\nthat the Gentiles are not human beings, the Torah permits the \\n\"Semites\" to enslave the Canaanites, and Arabs have no right to \\nresist Jewish settlement in Palestine. He says \"Zionist racism\" \\ndrew sustenance from \"modern racist ideology in Europe and \\nAmerica,\" which is based on Greek philosophy and Roman culture, \\nnotably Aristotle\\'s division of humanity into \"Greek humans and \\nnon-Greek savages,\" a view which the writer says was adopted by \\nthe Romans. He says this ideology was further strengthened by \\nMachiavellian thought. \\n  The writer goes on to warn of possible nuclear attacks on \\nArab capitals such as Damascus, Baghdad, Khartoum, or even \\nMecca, especially as the United States has prevented the Arabs \\nfrom acquiring similar weapons. \\n  He says: \"Such a possibility is not an illusion. The \\nconditions to which we have been reduced encourage the sons of \\nIsrael and Judah to consider it.\" \\n  He concludes by urging the overthrow of \"the chains of \\nsecular government\" because an Islamic government would respond \\nwith whatever weapons it had at hand and would proceed \"on the \\npath of glorious victory.\" \\n  ANTI-SUDAN BRITISH CONSPIRACY \\n  A 300-word report by Muhammad \\'Urfah on page 1 notes \"a \\nsecret document revealing a British conspiracy against the \\nMuslims in Sudan that is designed to seize the Nile sources\". \\nThis document is a letter circulated by a group of British \\nopposition politicians and reportedly sent by British Prime \\nMinister John Major to his foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, \\nspecifying Britain\\'s position on Sudan and other issues, \\nincluding Bosnia-Herzegovina. \\n  In the letter Major reportedly advocates south Sudan\\'s \\nsecession with the help of media publicity, claiming that Arab \\nMuslims are oppressing the Christian southerners, the aim being \\nto \"confront political Islam\" in that country and Africa in \\ngeneral. \\n  The document is said to reveal a report about the Nile \\nwater, \\nof which Israel hopes to have a share; the projected control of \\nall governments in the region in the 21st century; and the \\n\"Zionists\\' cooperation with the Turkish Government against Arab \\nregimes and Islamic organizations.\" \\n  The document reportedly discloses a British attempt to unite \\nsouth Sudan\\'s rebel factions with the help of a \\nBritish-influenced local church to guarantee British, rather \\nthan U.S., influence in the region. \\n  The document is said to hint at \"extensive military \\nintervention in south Sudan under UN supervision.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n\\nBFN \\n\\n [Commentary by the News Research and Commentary Group] \\n  [Text] Although Redha Malek's stepping down as Algerian \\nprime minister and Mokdad Sifi's replacing him is considered a \\nsign of the volatile political situation there, the change could \\nfind a solution to the prevailing crisis. \\n  Political analysts believe a dichotomy of views exists \\nwithin \\nthe Algerian ruling party. The first, which is headed by former \\nPrime Minister Redha Malek, believes in the ruthless suppression \\nof Islamists, that their elimination from the country's \\npolitical scene can end the Algerian political crisis, and that \\nwith financial assistance from the West, the unbridled economic \\ncrisis can be reined in. \\n  The second group--and it is not yet clear whether Mokdad \\nSifi \\nbelongs to this group--contends that Islamism is a \\nsociopolitical reality in Algeria with an extensive popular \\nbase. The acceptance of this reality can be a preamble to every \\nmeasure to solve the Algerian political crisis. \\n  Protagonists of the second view consider a security \\ncrackdown \\non the trend of Islamism as futile and advocate that \\nnegotiations with the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], delegation \\nof power to the FIS, and FIS involvement would give the \\ngovernment a better popular base. This would also guarantee a \\nsolution to the multifaceted crisis in the country. \\n  This group has a similar stance to the first group regarding \\nWestern financial assistance to solve the country's economic \\ncrisis. The domination of the former coupist council by the \\nfirst group and the current government appointed by it has \\ngenerated the impression that every Algerian prime minister \\nbelongs to the first group, that is, those who contribute to the \\nconcept of suppressing Islamic movements. But the performance \\nof the subsequent government, which merely worsened the social, \\npolitical, and economic crisis in Algeria, eroded this \\nimpression and confirmed its ineptitude. \\n  The resulting situation paved the way for the second group \\nto \\ncome to power, that is, those who believe in a political \\nsolution, not force, to resolve the multifaceted Algerian \\ncrisis. New Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi's stressing the \\nneed for extensive efforts to foster national solidarity is \\nperhaps a sign that the new prime minister has different views \\nfrom those of his predecessors. \\n  What is certain is that raising the level of national \\nsolidarity in Algeria--a prerequisite for resolving the \\ncountry's crisis--can only be achieved by displaying goodwill \\nand adopting an amicable path before the Islamists, not by \\ndenying political realities. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE GREATEST POLITICAL EXECUTIONER OF THE DECADE; \\n\\n\\nIN THE NAME OF GOD THE KHOMEINI DECADE BY ROBIN WRIGHT (SIMON & SCHUSTER: \\n$19.95; 284 PP.; 0-671-67235-5) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the contemporary world, the first draft of popular history is composed by \\njournalists. When a distinguished journalist who has covered a landmark story \\nfor 10 years writes a book about the event, the result can add depth, scope and \\nperspective to her original dispatches. Robin Wright is such a journalist, and \\nher account of the Iranian revolution surpasses the expectation. \\n\\n\\nThe title of the book, \"In the Name of God,\" signifies the centrality of \\nreligion (Shii Islam) in revolutionary Iran, and the subtitle, \"The Khomeini \\nDecade,\" recalls the Ayatollah\\'s dominant role in defining the concrete \\ndictates of the faith from the birth of the Islamic Republic on Feb. 11, 1979, \\nto the day of his death on June 3, 1989. \\n\\n\\nA chronology as well as an interpretive portrayal of events during this \\ntumultuous period, this book is intended for general readers but does not avoid \\nor impose labels or complex phenomena. Wright aims at explaining the degree to \\nwhich the Iranian revolution has succeeded or failed in pursuit of its \\nself-proclaimed goals. \\n\\n\\nWright, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, begins her lucid narrative by \\nplacing Iran\\'s grievances against the Shah\\'s regime in historical perspective, \\nand by doing so makes the Islamic revolution intelligible. Pointing out that \\nthe sudden fall of the Iranian state was a surprise not only to foreign \\nspecialists but also to native revolutionaries themselves, Wright shows that \\nAlexis de Tocqueville\\'s remark on the French Revolution -- \"Never was any such \\nevent so inevitable, yet so completely unforeseen\" -- is equally applicable to \\nthe Iranian cases. Thus when the Shah was forced into exile, his successors did \\nnot have a practical plan for the new Iran. \\n\\n\\nWhat united the diverse elements of the spontaneous mass movement was more \\nnegative than affirmative. For a variety of sociohistoric reasons, the vast \\nmajority of Iranians had come to believe that the destruction of the monarchy \\nwould necessarily improve their lives. The kind or the degree of this supposed \\ngain was not a matter of serious concern. \\n\\n\\nConsequently, in the early days of the victory, disagreements among the \\nrevolutionaries were so basic that calls for compromise invariably fell on deaf \\nears. Disputed issues included the name of the republic, the structure of \\nauthority, the role of the state in the national economy, the origin of \\npolitical legitimacy, the nature of foreign policy, women\\'s rights and the \\nextent of autonomy for the national minorities: In the midst of a multifaceted \\nclash of ideas over such questions, Khomeini remained the uncontestable source \\nof appeal and arbitration. In the beginning, he seemed to be above \\nfactionalism, but as time went on, his close ties with the fundamentalist \\nclerics became evident. \\n\\n\\nThe militant fundamentalists were determined to transform Iran into an Islamic \\nstate, but they had no clear idea of what the institutions and laws of such a \\nstate would be like. Even Khomeini, whose writings were more specific about \\npolitical matters than were those of any of his colleagues, merely assigned to \\nthe government the traditional duties of protecting Islam, defending the \\nfrontiers, administering justice and collecting taxes. \\n\\n\\nAs Wright correctly observes, for months after the fall of the shah, \"it was \\nnot at all clear that Khomeini intended for the Islamic Republic to become a \\ntheocracy, or a state ruled by the clergy.\" Indeed, evidence supports Wright\\'s \\nview that at first \"Khomeini seemed content to leave the workings of government \\nin the hands of the Tehran technocrats, while his role was at first limited to \\nguide or counselor during disputes.\" \\n\\n\\nThe rise of Khomeini as the ruler of a theocratic Iran was as unimaginable to \\nhim as it was to the Iranian people. In fact, few even saw him as a threat to \\nthe progressive aspirations of the revolution. Precipitating the birth of the \\nIranian theocracy were: 1. the capacity of fundamentalist teachers (mullahs) to \\ngalvanize the urban poor and control the network of mosque-centered committees \\nthroughout the country, 2. the pathetic fragmentation of the secular forces and \\n3. the lure of absolute power to Khomeini. Of these three factors, Wright \\nthoroughly analyzes the first, makes some perceptive comments on the second and \\nvirtually ignores the third. \\n\\n\\nThe seizure of the American embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979, was the first \\npivotal moment in the post-revolutionary power struggle because it produced an \\nirreversible advantage for the militant fundamentalists, drew Khomeini to the \\ncenter of decision-making in the daily affairs of the state, checkmated the \\nradical-left groups and put the liberal forces on the defensive. \\n\\n\\nThe demonstrations in front of the American embassy compound that immediately \\nfollowed the shah\\'s admission to the United States on Oct. 22, 1979, were \\norganized by the radical-left competitors of the clerics. This development \\ndeeply worried Khomeini and his lieutenants because it was the first occasion \\nsince the fall of the shah that leftists had taken the initiative in a major \\npublic mobilization. \\n\\n\\nPrime Minister Mehdi Bazargan and the liberal forces he represented were \\nopposed to such confrontation with Washington, but given the general public\\'s \\nperception of the shah\\'s admission to the United States as a hostile act toward \\nthe revolution, they could not mobilize much support for their position. \\n\\n\\nThe militant fundamentalists responded to this volatile situation by stealing \\nthe issue of anti-Americanism from the radical left. They sent a group of their \\nsupporters to occupy the embassy to take the U.S. diplomatic personnel hostage. \\nThis was one of the shrewdest moves Khomeini made in his political career. \\n\\n\\nWright has done an excellent job of explaining the dramatic impact of the \\nepisode on Iran\\'s domestic politics. She shows how Khomeini used the ensuing \\nhostage crisis to consolidate his power and disarm or discredit his opponents. \\nThe dividends he gained from the situation convinced him that America was more \\nuseful to him as an enemy than as a friend. \\n\\n\\nWright also demonstrates how the Iran-Iraq war played into the hands of the \\nmilitant fundamentalists and paved the way for the expansionist phase of the \\nIslamic revolution. For the Iraqi invasion of Iran on Sept. 22, 1980 provided \\nKhomeini with an opportunity to attempt to export the revolution in the name of \\ndefending Islam and Iran. In June, 1982, when Iran gained the upper hand in the \\nwar, Khomeini rejected any suggestion of settling the conflict through \\nnegotiation. \\n\\n\\nThe Ayatollah and his lieutenants were so mesmerized by their successes that \\nthey actually came to think that there was no limit to what their religious \\nzeal could achieve. The clerics\\' intoxication finally was ended when the Iraqis \\nmanaged to reverse the military balance and made it imperative for Khomeini to \\naccept U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, which called for a cease-fire and \\npeaceful resolution to the conflict. \\n\\n\\nThe guns fell silent at the end because both sides were exhausted, morally and \\neconomically, and because the Reagan Administration, in a reversal of its \\npolicy during the first seven years of the war, saw more benefit in ending the \\nfeud than in fueling it. A million deaths, 2 million wounded, hundreds of \\nbillions of dollars in material destruction and the immense suffering of the \\npeople could not move the 88-year-old spiritual leader of the Islamic Republic, \\nbut an actual threat to his regime was altogether a different matter. \\n\\n\\nWright\\'s assessments of the Islamic Republic\\'s performance are as valid as they \\nare painful. It seems that the achievements of the \"government of God\" are \\nlimited to its own survival and the sharing of political power \"beyond the \\nwealthy, Westernized elite.\" The cost of this accomplishment, it must be noted, \\nhas been massive repression and the spread of terror among dissidents. In the \\ndecade of Khomeini there have been nearly 15,000 confirmed political executions \\nin Iran -- far more than the combined number of such killings in the rest of \\nthe world combined. \\n\\n\\nAs for the Ayatollah\\'s ambition to spread his message abroad, evidence shows \\nthat \"Tehran\\'s brand of Shi\\'ite extremism never took hold except in \\nneighborhoods of chaotic Lebanon and among handfuls of Gulf Arabs.\" Even in \\nLebanon, the so-called pro-Iranian Hezbollah have been reduced to the mercenary \\ntypes. Khomeini\\'s fanatic followers in Lebanon came to a rude awakening with \\nthe revelation of the Ayatollah\\'s secret contacts with Washington and Tel Aviv. \\n\\n\\nIn the economic sphere, the ruling clerics brought chaos and misery to Iranian \\nsociety. Even the urban poor, their supposed constituency, were \"more \\nimpoverished during the revolution\\'s first decade than under the shah, with \\nlittle to show for the \\'dignity\\' that Khomeini had promised.\" And in the realm \\nof dictating \"moral\" conduct, the Islamic regime\\'s record is equally as dismal. \\nWhile people were whipped in public for drinking alcohol, underground \\nbootlegging became a multimillion-dollar trade in the theocracy. Similarly, \\neven after nearly 2,000 drug-related executions and incarceration of 50,000 \\naddicts in labor camps, official statistics put the number of addicts at 1 \\nmillion. \\n\\n\\nBefore the revolution, opium dominated drug use in Iran. Today heroin has \\ndisplaced opium -- a vengeful victory for modernization in the Islamic \\nRepublic. As Wright concludes, when Khomeini died on June 3, 1989, his legacy \\nincluded an uncertain future, a deeply polarized society, an increased \\ndependency on the outside world for the nation\\'s basic necessities, a cruel \\nmachinery of repression, Iraqi occupying forces on Iranian soil, a pariah \\nstatus for Iran in the international community, a devastated economy and a \\npervasive feeling of disillusionment or betrayal for millions of Iranians who \\nthought the revolution would produce some civility in their political life. \\n\\n\\nGiven Wright\\'s realistic portrayal of what the decade of Khomeini did to Iran, \\nit is puzzling that she chooses the religious honorific imam for Khomeini and \\npresents him as a man of holy qualities. He did use such words as faith, vision \\nand dream to characterize his motives and sensibilities. And after all, he was \\nnot the only national leader to have dragged God into war and politics; nor was \\nhe the first to leave the fighting to Him when the shortages of weapons, money \\nand men became critical. \\n\\n\\nBut we cannot forget the fact that it was his ignorant and inchoate view of the \\nworld that prolonged an internecine war for six years and directed Iran\\'s \\nrevolutionary energy toward the delusion of grandeur. In the words of Mahmud \\nDowlatabadi, Iran\\'s foremost novelist: under Khomeini\\'s guidance, \"The word \\n\\'war\\' became sanctified. The revolution, we were told, would flower in war.\" \\n\\n\\nIndeed, it was not religious faith but psychopathology of power that shaped \\nKhomeini\\'s choices and turned him into a despot. He personally approved mass \\nexecutions of political prisoners and never made an attempt to reason with his \\ncritics. He was a credible moral opponent of the shah, but once in power he \\nbecame a shrewd connoisseur of intrigue and an extremist practitioner of the \\n\"ends justifying the means\" game. \\n\\n\\nHe might have begun his career with wholesome intentions, but after 10 years \\nruling Iran, he demonstrated to us all that the exercise of absolute power can \\ninfect the prayer mat with more plague than it did the peacock throne. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n920124\\n\\n\\nFT  24 JAN 92 / Battle for hearts and minds in Central Asia: Fundamentalist\\nand mainstream Moslems, writes Tony Walker, are fighting for influence in\\nnew nations\\n\\n\\nNOWHERE is the creation of a clutch of new central Asian states from the old\\nSoviet Union being watched more obsessively than in the capitals of moderate\\nArabs fearful that the balance of influence in the Islamic world may be\\naltered to their disadvantage.\\nWhile the moderates held sway at a recent meeting in Dhakar of the Islamic\\nConference Organisation, they cannot be at all confident that Islamic\\ninstitutions will remain firmly in their grip in light of a restless Iranian\\nchallenge and the addition of new and possibly militant members.\\nBeyond worries about control of Islamic institutions, the moderate Arabs,\\nplus Turkey, are also concerned that the newly formed Islamic states of\\ncentral Asia will provide moral and political support for fundamentalists\\nthroughout the Middle East at a time when political Islam appears again to\\nbe on an upswing.\\nIntriguingly, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have joined in an attempt to counter\\ndevelopments in the former Soviet republics possibly detrimental to their\\nown interests and to Sunni (mainstream) Islam. Saudi money and Egypt's\\nabundant ulema, or religious guides, are being mobilised to spread the word\\nin central Asia in competition with the militant Shi'ism of Iran.\\nReligious notables from the former Soviet republics have also been invited\\nto Cairo for what is known as 'Preacher's Day' early next month, and Islamic\\nteachers will participate in courses on contemporary Islam run by the\\nal-Azhar religious authorities in the Egyptian capital.\\nMr Mohammed Mahjoub, Egypt's religious affairs minister, was quoted last\\nweek as saying pointedly that 'we are approaching a very critical stage. In\\nthis stage, Egypt, representing religious moderation, must lead in showing\\nthe magnanimity of Islam.'\\nMr Mahjoub's remarks coincided with worrying (for Arab moderates)\\ndevelopments in Algeria, where the military felt obliged to cancel\\ndemocratic elections that would have resulted in an overwhelming victory for\\nthe Islamicists.\\nThe constitutional coup in Algeria and reaction to it across the Middle East\\nexposed tensions and differences between moderate and militant regimes in\\nthe wake of the Gulf crisis, adding further to the region's unsettled mood.\\nAlgeria's new military rulers reacted bitterly to criticism voiced by Iran's\\nsupreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who declared that Algerian Moslems\\nwould defeat 'Satanic plots'.\\nAlgiers recalled its ambassador to Tehran and asked Iran's representative to\\nleave. Algeria also announced that it would stop representing Iran in the US\\nbecause of the 'virulent Iranian press campaign seeking to hit (Algeria's)\\nvital interests'.\\nThe argument between Algiers and Tehran might be dismissed as one of the\\nregion's periodic spats, but Iran efforts to play a more conspicuous role\\nregionally invests it with greater significance.\\nMr Fahmi Howeidi, Egypt's leading Iran specialist, believes, however, that\\nworries among moderate Arabs about Iran's intentions are exaggerated. He\\nsays its present activism should be viewed against a background of coming\\nelections for Iran's parliament.\\nMr Howeidi says that manoeuvring for control of the Majlis, which was\\nelected in 1988 and therefore the militant sway of the late Ayatollah\\nKhomeini, has obliged Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the pragmatic\\npresident, as the upholder of the Ayatollah's crusading vision, to act in\\norder to outflank the extremists and secure victory for his own people in\\nthe election.\\nThe Egyptian specialist said it would make no sense for Iran, which has\\ninvested much recently in wooing moderate Gulf regimes and improving its\\nprofile in the west, to appear to be fomenting trouble in the Arab world.\\nBut, while concern about Iranian intentions might be exaggerated in Arab\\ncapitals, it seems inevitable that competition in central Asia will cause\\ntensions with both the moderate Arabs and with Turkey, which is also\\nunderstandably staking its claim for influence.\\nIran's own concern about developments in the six new states to its north and\\nespecially in neighbouring Azerbaijan (the only one of the six where Shia\\npredominates) stem partly from worries about possible separatist tendencies\\nof its own minorities.\\nWhile Turkey was the very first country to recognise Azerbaijan, Iran\\ndelayed. This caution also extended to Tehran's recognition of the other\\nnewly independent states.\\nEvidence of Iranian sensitivity about developments on its borders came\\nrecently with criticism in the English-language Tehran Times, close to\\nPresident Rafsanjani, accusing Turkey of seeking to inflame nationalist\\nsentiment in central Asia. Diplomatic wariness has not, however, stopped\\nIran from seeking actively to woo these states.\\nIn December, Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, visited all\\nsix: the five Moslem-dominated republics of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan,\\nTajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kirgizia, and half-Moslem Kazakhstan.\\nArab moderates not only want to try to ensure that the newly formed central\\nAsian states become part of a pragmatic and western-leaning Islamic axis,\\nbut, perhaps more importantly, they wish to counter transfers of advanced\\nmilitary technology, and possibly even nuclear know-how, to Middle East\\nradicals. (Kazakhstan is home to part of the former Soviet nuclear arsenal).\\nWriting in the Kuwaiti daily Sawt al Kuwait, Mr Hassan Abu-Taleb, of Cairo's\\nal Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, voiced some of the\\nalarm felt when he observed:\\n'In the chaos accompanying the disintegration of the communist superpower,\\nthe chances are high that what lies ahead is a period of uncontrollable\\nnuclear proliferation that could transfer the arms to a number of other\\nstates and - even more dangerously - to 'unknown groups' that could use them\\nto blackmail the entire world.'\\nOther Egyptian commentators have taken up a similar theme. The weekly\\npublication Rose el-Yousef, commented that: 'Whereas the Arabs once needed\\nto deal only with the central Soviet authority, they must now establish\\nurgent and energetic contacts with all the independent states .. If we don't\\nmove now, those (Iran and Turkey) will beat us to close relations with the\\nnew countries.'\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Although nearly 70,000 voters marked ballots on April 11, a handful of \\nvotes denied Korenstein the majority she needed for outright victory. The \\nresults ought to persuade Californians everywhere that it matters a great deal \\nwhether they go to the polls. \\n\\n\\nNearly 305,000 voters were eligible to vote in the Korenstein election, but \\nsomething less than 25% actually did so. Maybe the non-voters didn't care about \\nthe quality of instruction in the public schools or how much the teachers will \\nget paid, the current controversies before the board. \\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, the low voter turnout shouldn't be all that surprising. It is \\npart of a national trend. \\n\\n\\nLast year's presidential election attracted only half of the nation's eligible \\nvoters, according to the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, \\nbased in Washington, D.C. The voter turnout dropped in 48 states last November. \\nCalifornia's turnout was a dismal 44.1%; only four states and the District of \\nColumbia made a poorer showing. Many voters stayed home, according to experts \\nat the research group, because they disliked both candidates, but making the \\nbest of a poor choice is often what voting is all about. In Los Angeles, the \\nrecent mayoral election drew barely 23% of the registered voters as Mayor Tom \\nBradley narrowly won an unprecedented fifth term on April 11. That was the \\nworst turnout in more than three decades despite pervasive concerns about \\ncrime, traffic, growth and other challenges facing the city. \\n\\n\\nVoter apathy must be contagious. Municipal elections in Orange County have \\ndrawn similarly low percentages. The turnout hit 23.5% in the elections last \\nyear in Los Alamitos, 25.9% in Fountain Valley and 22% in San Juan Capistrano, \\nwhich hold elections again next month. \\n\\n\\nNon-voters can always come up with a reason for not going to the polls. They \\nare too busy, too tired, overworked, too indifferent or too smug to mail in a \\nballot or go into the voting booth. Those who believe their vote doesn't count \\nshould take a hard look at Korenstein's experience. \\n\\n\\nOn the day after the election, Korenstein held -- although barely -- the \\nmajority she needed to keep her seat on the school board. After the absentee \\nballots were counted, Korenstein fell a few votes short. If another 57 \\nsupporters of Korenstein had gone to the polls in April, there would be no need \\nfor a runoff on June 6, persuasive evidence that every vote really does matter. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Political \\nscientists say we have too many elections for too many minor offices. \\n\\n\\nAnd a small group of political observers ventured that maybe it is all right \\nafter all that most of us ignore minor races such as the one on Tuesday\\'s \\nballot for the Los Angeles Community College District Board of Trustees. \\n\\n\\n\"I feel hard pressed to vote for community college board,\" said Raymond E. \\nWolfinger, professor of political science at UC Berkeley, and he suggested that \\nmost Californians are no different. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the city clerk\\'s office, turnout in the community college \\ndistricts was 9% and in the city proper 10.9% -- largely thanks to a \\ncomparatively strong 20% turnout in the 7th Council District. The record low, \\nset in 1983, is 8.6%. \\n\\n\\nTuesday\\'s poor showing follows on the heels of a record low turnout April 11 \\nfor the mayoral primary election. In that contest -- in which nearly half of \\nthe City Council was elected in addition to the mayor -- only 24.33% of \\nregistered voters went to the polls. \\n\\n\\nSome of the reasons for poor turnout -- such as apathy, poor education and the \\nincreasingly mobile and rootless nature of society -- seem insurmountable. \\n\\n\\nBut potential solutions, such as eliminating some elections and elected \\npositions, are just as provocative. \\n\\n\\nPoliticians themselves say the reasons for low voter participation -- and the \\nsolutions to the problem -- are political in nature. \\n\\n\\nThey say voters perceive their problems as so large that no candidate appears \\ncapable of providing solutions. \"If no one has an answer (to society\\'s \\nproblems), how do you make a choice?\" said Bob Naylor, former state Republican \\nParty chairman. \\n\\n\\nSome politicians say low voter turnout is the result of a homogenization of \\nideology, a blurring of the distinctions between candidates, and that makes \\nchoices more difficult. Naylor, paraphrasing former President Ronald Reagan, \\nsaid candidates for public office need to abandon the \"politics of pastels\" and \\n\"stand for something clear.\" Only then will voters respond, he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConcern Over Turnout \\n\\n\\nMany in the political process are concerned about slipping voter turnout. \\n\\n\\nOne strategy City Councilman Richard Alatorre is exploring is consolidation of \\nmunicipal elections with county and state elections. That would not only \\ncombine high-visibility contests and the lesser offices on the same ballot but \\nwould reduce the number of times voters go to the polls. \\n\\n\\nWolfinger points out that city residents have been asked to go to the polls \\nthree times in the past seven months. \"Let\\'s face it,\" he said, \"when you keep \\ndoing it, people lose interest.\" \\n\\n\\nBruce Cain, a professor of political science at Caltech, said other partial \\nsolutions are to adopt more accessible vote-by-mail programs and make voter \\nregistration easier by making it part of automobile registration. Only about \\n70% of eligible voters actually register, according to several studies. \\n\\n\\nLos Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez said the idea of consolidating elections \\n\"always comes up, but never seriously.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd he is not convinced that it would really make that much difference. \\nMartinez said there is a large \"drop-off\" on long ballots. Although many voters \\nwill cast a ballot for President or governor at the top of a ballot, they will \\npass over lesser offices such as judges at the bottom of the ballot, he said. \\n\\n\\nBut Martinez said new technology is making other alternatives, such as voting \\nby telephone or post card, possible, even if they will take a while to be \\naccepted. Even though many Americans do not take advantage of voting, \"people \\nwant confidence in the system,\" Martinez said. \\n\\n\\nVOTER TURNOUT \\n\\n\\nTurnout in Tuesday\\'s Los Angeles general municipal election was the second \\nlowest in at least 20 years, the city clerk\\'s office records showed: \\n\\n\\n1969: 62% \\n\\n\\n1971: 45% \\n\\n\\n1973: 64% \\n\\n\\n1975: 43% \\n\\n\\n1977: 29% \\n\\n\\n1979: 24% \\n\\n\\n1981: 30% \\n\\n\\n1983: 8.6% \\n\\n\\n1985: 22% \\n\\n\\n1987: 16% \\n\\n\\n1989: 10.9% \\n\\n\\nCompiled by researcher Cecilia Rasmussen \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n920415\\n\\n\\nFT  15 APR 92 / Half of America turns to the apathy party: The decline in\\nvoter participation in the US, especially among blacks\\n\\n\\nWHILE some US voters have shown how disgruntled they are with their\\npolitical leaders this year by voting them out of office, more have joined\\nthe other half who do not vote at all.\\nLast week, in New York state's apparently vigorously contested Democratic\\nprimary, fewer than 1m people troubled to register their preference between\\nGovernor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, former Governor Jerry Brown of California\\nand the phantom candidate, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts  - a\\n38 per cent fall from the turnout in 1988.\\nExcept for New Hampshire, which held the first primary, turnout has declined\\nuniformly this year. Only around 9.4m Democratic voters have turned out in\\nprimaries so far this year, compared with 11.8m at the same stage of the\\n1988 presidential campaign.\\nBut if voter participation has declined overall, in the black population it\\nhas plummeted: down 40 per cent in Georgia, for example, and down 61 per\\ncent in Louisiana.\\nSome of the low turnout, both in general and among black voters in\\nparticular, can be attributed to voters' dissatisfaction with the way in\\nwhich candidates are addressing the issues that most concern them, say\\nactivists working for greater voter participation.\\n'What we have seen so far is candidates of both parties speaking to the\\nso-called forgotten middle class but not couching their language in such a\\nway as to appeal to black voters,' says Ms Sonia Jarvis, executive director\\nof the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation.\\nAnother factor has been the attempt by many states, especially in the south,\\nto maximise their electoral clout by grouping their primaries.\\nWith seven states voting on March 3 and another 11 on March 10, so-called\\n'Super Tuesday', candidates had to spread their resources thinly and were\\nunable to whip up much enthusiasm among voters who barely knew their names,\\nfar less their faces or their policies.\\nBut low turnout also reflects both structural barriers to voting and a\\nlong-term trend of declining participation. Unlike other industrialised\\ncountries, the US requires its citizens to jump through several hoops to\\nregister to vote.\\nMany states, for example, require voters to appear in person at the\\nregistrar's office  - which may be open only during weekday office hours.\\nEven those that allow citizens to register by post sometime require\\nnotarised proof of identity.\\n'There is a notion that voting is really a privilege rather than a\\nfundamental right, and people have to prove themselves worthy by taking the\\ninitiative,' says Mr Ed Brown, director of the Voter Education Project  - an\\nAtlanta-based organisation which took the lead in breaking down the barriers\\nraised against black voters in the south in the 1960s, but which closed its\\ndoors last month for lack of money.\\nThe charitable foundations which used to fund its work have turned to other\\ncauses. Some, more politically aligned, became disillusioned in the 1980s as\\nvoter registration drives bore more fruit for the Republicans than for the\\nDemocratic party. Those that remain interested in voter participation have\\nturned to legislative efforts to make registration easier.\\nMs Jarvis says that registration rules in most states were drawn up either\\nafter the Civil War or at the turn of the century at a time of heavy\\nimmigration from central Europe, and were always intended to discriminate.\\nWhile blacks are no longer made to construe Greek or count the bubbles in a\\nbar of soap  - traditional tests used to prevent them from registering in\\nthe old south  - the barriers of inconvenience affect the generally\\nlower-income black population disproportionately.\\n'If you're poor and black and live in rural Mississippi and work in a\\ncatfish processing plant, no one is going to give you time off to go to\\nregister to vote,' Mr Brown says.\\nBut Mr Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American\\nElectorate, warns that there is a long-term trend of declining electoral\\nparticipation that reflects voters' disillusionment with the political\\nprocess.\\nChanges in the law to allow citizens to register to vote at the polling\\nbooth on election day might add another 6m or 7m voters to the 91.6m who\\nvoted in the last presidential election, he says, but would not reverse the\\ntrend.\\n'A lot of the declining participation has to do with the erosion of the will\\nto vote,' he says.\\nReduced black participation is likely to be particularly damaging to the\\nDemocratic candidate in the presidential election in November. Although the\\nblack vote has become much less monolithic than in the recent past, some 75\\nto 85 per cent are still likely to vote Democratic.\\nIt is not a matter of whether the Democratic candidate garners the black\\nvote, says Mr Brown, it is a question of how much.\\n'The view is that blacks have nowhere else to go but blacks always have\\nsomewhere to go: they can go fishing.'\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n           PARTICIPATION IN US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS\\n              (per cent of voting age population)\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nYear     %    Year   %     Year   %\\n1932    52.5  1952   61.6  1972   55.2\\n1936    56.9  1956   59.3  1976   53.5\\n1940    58.9  1960   62.8  1980   52.6\\n1944    56.0  1964   61.9  1984   53.1\\n1948    51.1  1968   60.9  1988   50.1\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSource: US Bureau of the Census\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOLDING AN ELECTION? FIRST WAKE THE VOTERS. . .; \\n\\n\\nPOLITICS: SEEKING TO ENGAGE THE ELECTORATE, POLITICAL PROFESSIONALS RELY ON \\nTECHNIQUES THAT ALIENATED PEOPLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor political professionals, this fall\\'s election looms as a landmark struggle. \\nIt will determine which party holds the governor\\'s chairs and state \\nlegislatures that will draw new congressional districts following the 1990 \\ncensus -- and so decide control of Congress through the end of the century. \\nAside from presidential campaigns, no contest this decade is more important to \\nthe people who run in, manage and fund elections. \\n\\n\\nFor the people who vote in U.S. elections, this campaign looks like another \\nyawn. \\n\\n\\nYawns were the big winner when one candidate in this fall\\'s California \\ngubernatorial race -- considered by some national strategists the most \\nimportant in the nation -- recently convened a focus group to quiz Los Angeles \\nvoters about the contenders. Many people in the room couldn\\'t name anything \\nRepublican Pete Wilson had done in the U.S. Senate, were unaware that Democrat \\nJohn K. Van de Kamp was the state\\'s attorney general and believed his rival for \\nthe Democratic nomination, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, still \\nheld that job. \\n\\n\\nBecause California is so vast and so much of its media pays so little attention \\nto politics, office-seekers here probably have more trouble reaching the public \\nthan in any other state. But the problem facing Wilson, Van de Kamp and \\nFeinstein is unique only in its severity. \\n\\n\\nIndifference is a fact of life for campaigns today. In many respects, it is the \\nshaping fact of life. Indifference is defining the style of U.S. campaigns. \\nParadoxically, it is driving candidates toward greater reliance on the tools \\nthat many believe are alienating voters: rapid-fire TV ads, personal attacks \\nand the use of symbolic, divisive \"wedge\" issues -- such as George Bush\\'s 1988 \\ncriticism of Michael S. Dukakis\\' membership in the American Civil Liberties \\nUnion. These tools may engender political cynicism, but they provide the flash \\nand emotion politicians need to reach an increasingly jaded and distracted \\nelectorate. The more cynical the public, the more flash and emotion campaigns \\nneed -- and the more they employ the weapons of manipulation that encourage \\ncynicism. \\n\\n\\nFor challengers, the problem is obvious: getting anyone to pay enough attention \\nto learn their names. But even incumbents are finding it difficult to carve out \\na strong public profile. Although voters typically give high marks to their \\ngovernors and senators when surveyed, their judgments often depend more on \\nvague impression than deep affection. \\n\\n\\nAnd those numbers can plunge faster than the stock market on a jittery Monday. \\nSen. Alan Cranston is the latest veteran politician to learn this. Cranston has \\nrepresented California in the Senate for more than 20 years, and yet the \\ndisclosure of his intervention on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan owner \\nCharles H. Keating Jr. was enough to reverse the public\\'s opinion virtually \\novernight: Cranston\\'s ratings collapsed from 56% positive to 58% negative in \\nLos Angeles Times polls only two months apart. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s hard to think of many politicians to whom the phrase \\'beloved\\' applies,\" \\nsaid Republican media consultant Larry McCarthy, who is working with Wilson in \\nthe gubernatorial race. \"They may have won respect, not to mention reelection, \\nbut it is hard to think of many who have really a personal bond with their \\nelectorate. . . . Cranston suffers from what every politician suffers from: \\nThey have a very fragile base.\" \\n\\n\\nThat awareness is driving campaign strategy for the 1990s. In this atmosphere \\nof political disengagement, TV commercials are simultaneously becoming more \\nimportant and less efficient. Because so many voters lack the motivation to \\nlook elsewhere for insight into the candidates, campaigns are rushing ads to \\ntelevision earlier and more heavily, hoping to define themselves before their \\nopponents do. But voters have become so accustomed to political commercials -- \\nand are so overwhelmed by the proliferation of all commercials -- that they are \\nmore likely to change channels or simply ignore them, many consultants say. \\n\\n\\nCandidates find themselves in the position of farmers who have to spray twice \\nas much pesticide to reach targets increasingly resistant to the poison. \"When \\nthey see another guy with a 40-buck haircut talking about crime, zap, they \\nchange the channel,\" said GOP media consultant Mike Murphy. \"They\\'ve heard all \\nthat stuff before and there is a credibility problem. You blend into the \\nbackground.\" \\n\\n\\nFor politicians, the communications problem is further complicated by the \\nfractionated audience; arguably, the middle- to upper-income people who vote \\nmost regularly spend the least time watching the traditional networks and local \\nindependent channels where campaigns concentrate their ads. In fact, as some \\npolitical consultants note, those upper-income households often watch premium \\ncable channels that prohibit advertising or rent movies for the VCR -- \\ndiversions that remove them altogether from an ad\\'s potential audience. \\n\\n\\nThus candidates are finding fewer opportunities to reach voters. That heightens \\nthe importance of what GOP National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater has dubbed \\n\"wedge issues\" -- symbolic, emotional concerns that quickly divide the \\nelectorate. \"This environment invites issues that people can work out without a \\nlot of information, that are easy to understand and have a \\'right\\' and \\'wrong\\' \\nside,\" said Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg. \\n\\n\\nOf all wedge issues, abortion now seems most potent. At a time when government \\nactions seem distant and abstract to most Americans, abortion is the exception. \\nIt has generated such strong political reaction precisely because it appears to \\nbe one of the rare government decisions that affects individual lives. The \\nirony is that, because the Supreme Court\\'s Webster decision last year gave the \\nstates more leeway to regulate abortion, this polarizing energy will be \\nchanneled primarily into the traditionally nonideological state legislative and \\ngubernatorial races -- such as the recent contests in New Jersey and Virginia. \\n\"The battle lines have completely changed,\" said Michelle M. Davis, executive \\ndirector of the Republican Governors Assn. (In California, because all three \\ngubernatorial candidates share pro-choice views, abortion is likely to be less \\ncentral.) \\n\\n\\nFor the same reasons most campaigns will rely on wedge issues, they will remain \\ndependent on negative advertisements. Though consultants and candidates swore \\noff the stuff after excessively vitriolic attacks in New Jersey and Virginia \\nappeared to backfire, don\\'t bet on them holstering the invective for long. The \\nreason: When people know little about candidates and are not inclined to absorb \\nmuch information, emotional, negative ads are the most efficient way to move \\nthe polls, many consultants believe. \"Negative ads generally stick faster than \\npositive ads,\" said Murphy. \"You get more bang for the buck.\" \\n\\n\\nAt the most profound level, the pattern of public disengagement from politics \\nis becoming self-reinforcing. With each passing election, candidates seem to \\nspend less time with ordinary people and more time shuttling between exclusive \\nfund-raisers and recording studios -- hoping that enough money and clever \\ncommercials will finally overwhelm the electorate\\'s indifference. This makes it \\nlogical that potential voters find little to interest them in campaigns -- and \\npolitics drifts toward the margin of national life. Even as political change is \\nopening long-shuttered societies across Europe and exhilarating millions, U.S. \\npolitics is attenuating into an insider\\'s game -- a treadmill that isolates our \\npoliticians from the people they hope to represent. That\\'s a development more \\nworthy of anger than indifference. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

The second reason, more evident than usual, is the \\nabundance of campaign reform ideas that are just plain dumb. \\n\\n\\nOne would think, from the fevered cries of Common Cause and various members of \\nCongress, that our electoral system had hit new depths of corruption that no \\nsensible citizen could tolerate. Such gross exaggerations win headlines for \\nlobbyists and lawmakers but ignore the real reasons why steadily fewer people \\nbother to vote. \\n\\n\\nThe simple fact is that citizens are busier and more distracted from politics \\nthan at any previous time in the history of the republic. As two-paycheck \\nmarriages become the norm, mom and dad have less time for the children and \\nperhaps none at all for politics. The same applies, double, to ever-increasing \\nsingle-parent households. \\n\\n\\nOf course, Americans in the past worked hard, but for our forebears politics \\nwas often a raucous spectator sport. No more. Why bother with the droning of \\ncandidates when cable television, professional sports and Nintendo are at hand? \\nThe simple fact is that Americans have at their disposal more immediate \\nentertainment. Is it any wonder that politics seems less important, \\nparticularly to the young, who wallow in electronic distraction? \\n\\n\\nGiven this situation, proposals to restrict political commercials to a \"talking \\nhead\" format or to ban the notorious 30-second spots would only reinforce mass \\nindifference. The solution to electronic politics is not to make it more \\nboring, though certainly that is what many prim reformers have in mind when \\nthey ask for more \"serious discussion of the issues.\" \\n\\n\\nMany reformers also claim that too much money is spent in election campaigns. \\nThe recently passed Senate campaign reform bill operates on that premise by \\nestablishing spending limits. But why, when electoral politics is already \\ncrowded out by distractions, try to limit its ability to reach people through \\nthe media? Unless candidates are granted big blocks of time to use as they \\nwish, less spending on TV will mean that even fewer voters will learn anything \\nabout who is running and why. \\n\\n\\nCertainly some reforms are needed. Access to money for competing candidates \\nneeds to be made more equal, and political consultants need to chastise \\nmiscreants in their trade more severely. But keep the race lively and very much \\non television, or voters will keep deserting the polls. \\n\\n\\nThe elite interest groups and politicians dominating the debate on campaign \\nreform have forgotten the circumstances of the average voter.

Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American \\nElectorate, a Washington-based group that studies voting trends, said that \\npreliminary calculations showed turnout almost exactly equal to the 36.4% in \\n1986, a post-World War II low. \\n\\n\\nBut that figure masked wide variations across the country. Relative to 1986, \\nthe last midterm election, turnout was up substantially in Massachusetts, the \\nsite of a closely contested gubernatorial race; North Carolina, where \\nconservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms turned back a black Democratic \\nchallenger, Harvey Gantt; and Minnesota, which saw tight struggles for both \\ngovernor and senator. A higher percentage of eligible voters also came to the \\npolls in Kentucky, the District of Columbia, Maine, Connecticut, Ohio and Iowa. \\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, California, New York and Florida all saw substantial \\ndeclines. Preliminary figures assembled by Gans indicate that only 32.7% of \\neligible voters came out in California (though he cautions that final \\ncalculations may slightly raise the total), just 29.1% in New York, and 34.6% \\nin Florida. The raucous governor\\'s race in Texas won by Democrat Ann Richards \\nproduced a slight increase in turnout, but only to 30.7%. \\n\\n\\nSeveral other states with close races also fell off. \"Oregon, Kansas, Alabama, \\nHawaii, Oklahoma, Illinois -- all had highly competitive races and all of them \\nhad lower turnouts,\" said Gans. \\n\\n\\nIn some states, the turnout pattern appeared to be a key -- if not decisive -- \\nfactor in the results.

            "{'text': '\\n\\nCSO \\n\\n [Commentary by Enrique Santos Calderon: \"The Echo of the \\nBallot Boxes\"] \\n  [Text] A lot of abstention, yes, but what could be \\nexpected, given the confusion, the lack of seriousness, the \\nabsence of ideas, and the down-home populism that are proving to \\nbe one of the most debatable legacies of the Constitution of \\n1991? \\n  Moreover, it did not strike me as all that dramatic. \\nHistorically, voter participation in Colombia has always left a \\ngreat deal to be desired. With a few extraordinary exceptions, \\nsuch as the plebiscite of 1957, most elections have had little \\nmore than a 60-percent turnout. The abstention rate reached 70 \\npercent in the elections for the Constituent Assembly in 1991. \\nAfter the congressional repeal, the elections to choose a new \\none had a 65-percent abstention rate. \\n  This is disturbing, no matter how you look at it. It would \\nbe \\nbetter to see the voter turnouts of 80 and even 90 percent that \\ndemocracies such as Italy, Spain, and Costa Rica have. Not \\nbecause voting is mandatory--that is a disagreeable \\nrequirement--but because they have greater political maturity \\nand democratic consciousness. \\n  Indifference, cynicism, apathy, skepticism, ignorance, \\nrejection, or complacency--all these and more explain the \\npersistence of abstentionism in Colombia. And it is not \\nexclusive to us; in the United States, to choose an example not \\ntoo far away, voter turnout is hardly ever more than 50 percent. \\n  It is significant, in any event, that with so much political \\nopenness, so many new civil rights, the proliferation of \\nelectoral lists, new groups, special districts for blacks and \\nIndians, etc., not only do people not flock to the polls, but \\nvoter participation actually declines. This is something to \\nthink about. \\n  Furthermore, if blank ballots, the citizen\\'s most explicit \\nand conscientious way of expressing his repudiation for \\neverything, are not given enough attention, people will feel \\nthat this form of protest vote is not worth the trouble, either, \\nand will be discouraged from participating. \\n  A central conclusion to be drawn from these legislative \\nelections is that there are no national leaders. Only 16 \\nsenators were elected by quotas, and the impressive battle for \\nthe leftovers reflects an fragmented political scene in which \\nthere is not a single figure with national appeal. \\n  There are so many things to remark upon in these elections: \\nthe return of longstanding but very weakened electoral barons, \\nsuch as Guerra Serna and Name Teran; the decline of others, such \\nas Gustavo Dajer, Salcedo Baldion, and Humberto Pelaez; \\nsurprises such as that of Jimmy Chamorro, which confirm the \\npolitical consolidation of the Christian groups; phenomena such \\nas Poncho Renteria, whose 20,000-odd votes can be considered a \\nprotest against the political class. \\n  I was saddened by the disappearance of Galanism as a \\nparliamentary force and the absence of figures such as Maria \\nCristina Ocampo, Juan Lozano, and Alfonso Valdivieso from \\nCongress. No leader has been able to fill that void (Gaviria is \\nanother matter), and the petty bickering they got involved in \\nwas the final blow to that liberal faction in Congress. \\n  I was also disturbed by the defeat of the M-19 Democratic \\nAlliance (AD M-19). It was completely annihilated, losing all 12 \\nseats. Figures such as Vera Grabe, Anibal Palacios, Bernardo \\nGutierrez, and Eduardo Chaves will not be around anymore. We may \\nhave disagreed with them, but they were an active presence and \\nrepresented voices of criticism and debate. The debacle of the \\n\"M\" confirms the limits of populism. But the parliamentary \\ndisappearance of the left (with the exceptions of Cepeda of the \\nPC [Conservative Party] and Jorge Santos of the Revolutionary \\nIndependent Worker Movement, MOIR) may send the wrong signal to \\narmed groups about the futility of the parliamentary, legal \\nstruggle. \\n  Some columnists, such as Francisco Santos, have expressed \\nthe \\nopinion that the big winner in these elections was Andres \\nPastrana, while Ernesto Samper lost out. This is a dubious \\nargument, apparently based on the fact that the conservatives \\ndoubled their seats in the Senate--from 16 to 32--and in \\nparticular on the fact that Samper got 1.5 million votes less \\nthan Gaviria did in the Liberal Consultation of 1990. \\n  It should be noted, however, that at that time of \\nindignation \\nand grief, people voted overwhelmingly against the dictatorship \\nof terror that the drug lords were trying to impose, and in \\nfavor of the person who had been designated the successor of the \\nslain leader. When they feel that something important is at \\nstake--the survival of the system, for example--they go more \\ndecisively to the polls. \\n  The results of the legislative elections can be interpreted \\nin a number of ways, and everyone talks about the party \\naccording to how it went for them. But now that the electoral \\nscene has been cleared of the confusion of lists and the \\nquestion of the vice presidencies has been resolved, it is time \\nfor the home stretch in the race between Samper and Pastrana. \\n  Samper made a big hit by naming Humberto De la Calle as his \\nrunning mate. He is the ideal vice president, given his training \\nand experience, his personal abilities, and his presidential \\nstature. The Samper-De la Calle ticket clears the way for the \\nLiberals and significantly strengthens Samper\\'s presidential \\nchances in an election where every vote will count. \\n  Pastrana\\'s ticket, on the other hand, does not have a \\ncomparable attraction. Not because Luis Fernando Ramirez is not \\nup to the job, but because he does not give Andres what De la \\nCalle gives Ernesto. The ticket looks very \"kindergartenish.\" \\nLacking a candidate of De la Calle\\'s stature, one whom Pastrana \\nsought desperately, or a figure like Noemi Sanin, who prefers to \\nsave herself for more dignified jobs, the Pastrana-Ramirez \\nticket lacks that element of complementarity, that charismatic \\nattractiveness that wins votes, which the Samper-De la Calle \\nticket does have. \\n  Now, let the presidential campaign begin in earnest. Let us \\nsee the debates and the clash of ideas between the presidential \\nand vice presidential aspirants. We have two months to find out \\nhow they plan to govern us; to know what their specific \\nproposals are for peace, for the economy, and for the social \\nills that plague Colombians; and above all, to compare them. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

But before hastening to tutor others about \\nself-government, we must reckon with Americans\\' discontent with our own \\ndemocracy -- a \"politics of irrelevance, of obscurantism,\" in the words of \\nWalter Mondale; a democracy in which \"bull permeates everything,\" according to \\nLee Atwater. Revitalizing our democracy should be at the top of our national \\nagenda, but to make progress, we need to be clearer about what we strive for. \\n\\n\\nOur contemporary conception of democracy owes more than most observers \\nrecognize to the Austrian economic historian Joseph Schumpeter, who emigrated \\nto this country in the 1930s. Impatient with idealistic theories about popular \\nrule, Schumpeter defined democracy as merely \" . . . a competitive struggle for \\nthe people\\'s vote.\" Think of political parties as firms competing for market \\nshare, he said, much as Cheerios and corn flakes vie for a place at our \\nbreakfast tables today. Think of politicians as merchandisers, a modern-day \\nSchumpeter might say. Think of voters as manipulable consumers, uninformed \\nabout public issues, swayable through jingles and cartoons. Think of public \\npolicy, not as the outcome of a collective deliberation about the public \\ninterest, but as a byproduct of private interest, the mere residue of campaign \\nstrategy. \\n\\n\\nSchumpeter\\'s interpretation of modern democratic politics turned out to be \\nremarkably prescient. He forecast, in effect, the central trend in American \\npolitics of the last half-century. When we talk now about democracy and its \\ndiscontents, we focus almost entirely on political campaigns and marketing. We \\nworry about sound bites and campaign spending. We lament \"attack ads\" and \\ntrivializing press coverage and low voter turnout. We propose public financing \\nof campaigns and journalistic restraint. And this inside-the-Beltway debate \\nabout political reform follows Schumpeter\\'s lead by mindlessly assuming that \\nthe core of democracy is the electoral campaign. \\n\\n\\nBut it need not be so. An even earlier European visitor to our shores, Alexis \\nde Tocqueville, offered a quite different view of \"democracy in America.\" \\nTocqueville\\'s vision, admittedly rooted in the less urban, less frenetic \\nAmerica of the early 19th Century, highlighted the engagement of ordinary \\ncitizens in public affairs. \\n\\n\\nAmerican democracy, according to Tocqueville, presumed a widely shared sense of \\nsocial solidarity and civic obligation. The organizational sinews of our \\ndemocracy were community associations, not electoral marketeers. Our democracy \\nrelied on our readiness to share responsibility for common problems. Democratic \\ndeliberation, a modern Tocqueville would say, rests on black churches and \\nRotary Clubs and Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Drop-a-Dime anti-drug \\ncrusades. \\n\\n\\nDemocracy cannot be subcontracted to campaign strategists and focus groups. \\nResponsible consideration of the \"big\" questions of our time -- the twin \\ndeficits, the future of East-West relations, and so on -- must grow from \\npractical experience in civic discussions of dozens of local issues -- school \\nreform, homelessness, environmental abuses -- in thousands of communities \\nacross the land. It is no accident that recent evidence suggests that the most \\neffective means of combatting the plague of drugs is to engage the active \\nparticipation of neighborhood groups. \\n\\n\\nIf the paramount issue in American politics of the 1980s was making markets \\nwork better, the principal challenge of the 1990s will be to make democracy \\nwork better. A new era of practical reform is urgently needed. But lasting \\nreform must begin at the grass roots, with Tocqueville\\'s robust vision rather \\nthan Schumpeter\\'s crass and shallow view. Our schools and universities, our \\ncivic, business and religious leaders, our press -- and yes, even our \\npoliticians -- must join in an effort to restore vigor to grass-roots \\norganizations, to reconnect with one another and with the commonweal. Campaign \\nreforms may be needed, but a reinvigorated emphasis on public engagement and \\ncivic solidarity is even more urgent. \\n\\n\\nThe key to revitalizing American democracy rests not in the hands of the \\ncampaign strategist, or even the quavering candidate, but in our own. We must \\ntake responsibility for attacking our problems together, rather than just \\npointing angrily from the sidelines at those who fail to do it for us. \\n\\n\\nTo the extent that the recent revolutions in Eastern Europe are grass-roots \\ninitiatives by millions of newly unfettered citizens, and that their elections \\nare vehicles for debating basic political principles and philosophies, these \\nnew nations are closer to adopting Tocqueville\\'s vision of democracy than \\nSchumpeter\\'s. And to that extent, we have something to learn about democracy \\nfrom them, as well. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Of those who were asked if they would \\nstand by their choice \"no matter what\" 97 percent of PAC \\nsupporters said they would. \\n  Worrying for the DP [Democratic Party] must be the result \\nwhich shows that only 59 percent of its supporters are certain \\nnothing can change their minds. \\n  CHANGE \\n  What would make people who have made up their minds switch \\ntheir vote? \\n  Nothing, said 88 percent. \\n  If the party did something I strongly disagreed with, say 4 \\npercent. \\n  If another party made promises or policies I strongly agreed \\nwith, say 4 percent. \\n  If someone threatened or intimidated me, say 2 percent. \\n  If parents, partner or friends sway me, say 1 percent. \\n  A few gave reasons such as if their party withdrew, if \\nminority groups were disregarded, and if their party changed its \\npolicies or broke its promises. \\n  UNCERTAINTY \\n  Why are people uncertain about their choice? \\n  The two main reasons are uninterest and ignorance. \\n  These were the answers by people who are still undecided \\nabout their choice: I\\'m not interested in politics or the \\nelection (25 percent, who were more likely to be coloureds or \\nIndians). \\n  I don\\'t know what is going on politically (19 percent, \\ncoloureds, Indians, lower income, over-50s). \\n  I like more than one party and can\\'t decide which to vote \\nfor \\n(15 percent, upper income whites). \\n  I don\\'t know what each of the parties stands for (12 \\npercent), and I don\\'t like or trust any of the parties or \\nleaders (9 percent). \\n  Minor reasons were: I don\\'t know how to vote; I don\\'t know \\nwhere to vote; my vote won\\'t make a difference; promises are not \\nbeing kept; have not decided yet; parties are changing their \\npolicies and, lots can still happen. \\n  FREEDOM FRONT, 7 PERCENT? \\n  General Constand Viljoen\\'s Freedom Front (FF), the electoral \\nvehicle of conservative whites, is the wild card in next month\\'s \\nelection. \\n  A late entrant to the race, the front\\'s showing is \\nunpredictable as fieldwork was conducted before it decided to \\ntake part in the election. \\n  However, if we assume a large proportion of CP [Conservative \\nParty] and some white IFP and most Volksfront [National Front] \\nsupporters will vote for it, the FF could get as much as 7 \\npercent of the vote. \\n  This is not a scientific research prediction but only an \\nestimation. \\n  NATAL \\n  Natal is the area where those who want a free and fair \\nelection just do not know what is going to happen. Will most \\npeople be able to vote? How much violence and intimidation will \\nthere be? Will voting in all areas be declared valid after the \\nelection? There are all these doubts, but of those who were \\nprepared to name a party 85 percent had no doubt they would \\nstick to this party \"no matter what happens\". \\n  Only 54 percent of people polled were prepared to name their \\nchoice. The remainder were either not sure who to vote for (19 \\npercent), not prepared to say (15 percent) or said they could \\nnot or would not vote (12 percent). \\n  Of all those polled in Natal, 22 percent said they would \\nvote \\nfor the ANC, 16 percent for the NP [National Party], 12 percent \\nfor the IFP and 4 percent for \"others\". The overall result \\ncould be greatly effected by those who go to the polls and those \\nwho stay away either because of intimidation and violence or \\nbecause they want to vote for the IFP and no other party. \\n  The main findings: No dramatic shift in the past three months \\n  THE ANC \\n  Has shown a 5 percent loss, mainly from Indians who have \\nswitched to the NP. Another big loss is in the upper-income \\ncategory. \\n  THE NP \\n  Is recovering some of the support it lost over the past year \\nor so and has grown (about 6 percent) mainly at the expense of \\nthe ANC. \\n  THE PAC \\n  Has shown a 1 percent gain in black and coloured \\ncommunities, \\nthe 25-35 age group and in the Cape and Free State. \\n  THE FREEDOM FRONT \\n  Is difficult to assess as fieldwork was carried out before \\nit \\ndecided to take part in the election and, therefore, there is no \\nshift pattern. \\n  THE DP \\n  Has remained static with moderate gains among coloureds.

            "{'text': '\\n\\nBFN \\n\\n  [Text] The security forces face four phases of potential \\ndisorder in the election process. One is the run-up during \\nwhich groups with low political tolerance try to intimidate one \\nanother, as well as other parties whose tradition of tolerance \\nis perceived as weakness. This has already begun, the process \\nalready marked by events such as the Johannesburg massacre, the \\nintensification of communal violence in kwaZulu/Natal and on the \\nEast Rand and -- on a decidedly lower key -- the breaking up of \\nNP [National Party] and DP [Democratic Party] meetings. \\n  Next is the polling period when intimidation is likely to \\nintensify (especially if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stays \\nout of the election and the very act of voting becomes a public \\npolitical statement). Confusion and panic are possible at the \\npolling stations, where most voters have absolutely no \\nexperience of the process. Attempts to interfere with the \\npolling process are possible, while tensions could be created by \\npeople marching in large groups to cast their vote, out of a \\nsense of insecurity. \\n  A period of over-exuberance could threaten public order \\nimmediately after the results are made known. It would be \\nexacerbated if the ANC should register the kind of runaway \\nvictory that could encourage some of its supporters to press for \\na scrapping of the power-sharing mechanisms of the interim \\nconstitution. It is possible elements of the disadvantaged \\nclasses will have totally unrealistic expectations and will \\nstream into the suburbs to claim their houses, swimming pools \\nand cars. And the losers could seek to give forceful expression \\nto their rejection of the outcome. \\n  Finally, a phase of disillusioned anger is almost certain, \\nand this could occur after the military reservists have been \\ndemobilised. \\n  Chris de Kock and Charl Schutte, of the Human Sciences \\nResearch Council, examine this question in depth in an empirical \\nstudy of the question of violence over the elections. They note \\nthat posters promoting voter literacy pose the question: \"Why \\nvote?\" then answer: \"Education, housing, jobs and peace.\" They \\nask if the compilers are ignorant of the theory of rising \\nexpectations or whether they want to pass on a subtle message \\nstimulating such expectations. \\n  \"Whatever their reasons, there can be little doubt they are \\ndoing an elected transitional government a great disservice. \\nExpectations of immediate gratification in terms of housing, \\neducation, work and peace are being aroused in the largest \\nsegment of the South African population.\" \\n  They say no transition government could meet such \\nexpectations in a short period, which will cause high levels of \\nfrustration and aggression to be exploited by enemies of the \\ntransitional government. \"One should also not lose sight of the \\nfact that the black population in particular, after a decade of \\nungovernability and not paying for services and alternative \\nstructures, will not recognise the authority of a transitional \\ngovernment that does not \\'deliver the goods\\' overnight.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\nLanguage:  Spanish \\nArticle Type:CSO \\n\\n [Article by Carlos Murcia: \"Candidates\\' Offensive Against \\nVoter Apathy\"] \\n  [Text] In the weeks ahead, particularly in \\nJanuary, presidential and congressional candidates will launch a \\nmajor propaganda and proselytizing offensive aimed at \\npenetrating the apathy that has seriously affected the election \\ncampaign. \\n  Many candidates are very concerned about the conclusions \\ndrawn by pollsters suggesting that 40 to 50 percent of all \\nColombians have no interest in the four elections to be held in \\n1994. The number of undecided voters is also high. Under such \\nconditions, if politicians do not adopt a more convincing \\nattitude toward the voters, more could abstain than in previous \\nyears, these same analysts say. \\n  Neither presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano nor his \\ncampaign managers and advisers agree. They predict that \\nenthusiasm among Liberals will pick up in 1994 and equal that \\nseen in previous campaigns. They claim that Liberals could make \\nup 55 or 60 percent of the total number of voters. They estimate \\nthat over 3.5 million Liberals will vote, 2 million for Samper \\nand the rest split by the remaining four precandidates still in \\nthe race by 13 March: Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lemos \\nSimmonds, Rodolfo Gonzalez, and David Turbay. It is rumored that \\nLuis Guillermo Sorzano is preparing to launch his candidacy for \\nthe Senate although he has delayed the announcement. \\n  Election Calculations \\n  They estimate that some 6 million persons will go to the \\npolls to cast their ballots for the various parties and groups \\nin the congressional elections. For obvious reasons, that figure \\ncould be somewhat lower for the presidential elections because \\nthe lure and intensive work of congressional candidates will be \\nmissing. However, at the last minute, the element of the mayoral \\nand gubernatorial races could possibly rouse voters out of their \\napathy. \\n  The Conservative election between presidential candidates \\ncalled by the union of the \"rebel quintuplets\": Rodrigo Marin, \\nRodrigo Llorente, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Gabriel Melo, and \\nRoberto Gerlein, but rejected by those following the guidelines \\nof the Conservative leadership supporting Andres Pastrana, could \\nrally some 600,000 votes, according to its organizers\\' \\nestimates. However, when one considers that the Conservative \\nParty could win nearly 160,000 votes for Congress, the party \\ncould find itself in a difficult situation due to the split into \\ntwo major blocs for the 8 May elections. One group would back \\nAndres Pastrana while the other would rally behind the candidate \\nchosen from among Rodrigo Marin, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Rodrigo \\nLlorente, Gabriel Melo, and Roberto Gerlein. \\n  Under these conditions, the Conservative picture does not \\nlook particularly promising because Alvaro Gomez Hurtado is \\nexpected to make his political move following the 13 March \\nelections and there is no indication of which way he will go. \\nWhile Gomez Hurtado has not sided with either faction, his \\nsilence is an obvious sign of indirect support for the \"rebel\" \\nelection. \\n  It will not be easy to control Congress for the coming \\nelections because senatorial candidacies are nationwide. This \\nfact forces candidates to spread out all over the country, \\nchanging the terms of regional politics. In addition, the \\nseparation of congressional elections from those for councils, \\nassemblies, mayoralties, and governorships leads one to think \\nthat terrorist groups might do their utmost to disturb law and \\norder. \\n  Everything To Win \\n  Although public opinion polls point to a possible tie \\nbetween \\nSamper and Pastrana on the first presidential ballot, it should \\nbe noted that after the Liberal nomination, the Liberal \\nprecandidates now opposing Samper will back him. In contrast, \\nPastrana will face a split in his party that appears to be \\nirreversible. While Pastrana could possibly win a few Liberal or \\nindependent followers, he will not have other elements in his \\ncamp like those that backed Belisario Betancur\\'s national \\ncandidacy in his race against Alfonso Lopez Michelsen. The \\nlatter was a candidate who faced Liberal resistance and, above \\nall, a very strong rival in the ranks of his own party: Luis \\nCarlos Galan, who is a far cry from Enrique Parejo. \\n  Among his political assets for 1994, Samper can also rely on \\nthe fact that Gaviria\\'s positive image resulting from the blows \\nthe latter dealt to drug trafficking will help him more than \\nthey will Pastrana. This is so even though he has had to put \\nsome distance between himself and this government on such issues \\nas agrarian policy, the economic liberalization program, and \\nsocial security reform. He also hopes to get on well with the \\nfollowers and leadership of the Democratic Alliance M-19, mainly \\nbecause of similar positions on many social, economic, and \\npolitical issues. \\n  Favorable Star \\n  Andres Pastrana, to whom the past two weeks have not been \\nkind because of the revolt of the quintuplet union and because \\nof what happened to his cousin, Gustavo Pastrana Gomez, \\ndiplomatic adviser in Uruguay, is confident that his good rating \\nin public opinion polls will hold until May because to date, his \\ncampaign has been waged more on image than on any platform. His \\nvisit to Venezuela on Wednesday was an attempt to win back \\npoints and divert attention to other issues. In that \\ninternational action he had the support of Development Minister \\nLuis Alberto Moreno, his future campaign director. \\n  All predictions revolve around two key persons in the \\ncampaign: Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper, assuming that no \\nblows will be struck in the elections. However, Enrique Parejo, \\nMiguel Alfredo Maza Marquez, Antonio Navarro, Humberto de la \\nCalle, and Carlos Lemos are confident that the rules of play \\nwill change in their favor and that the \"sure bets\" are in for a \\nsurprise. \"They have ruled us out ahead of time, but they are \\ngoing to get the surprise of their lives,\" Parejo says, dreaming \\nof an election fluke. \"It\\'s not over yet,\" De la Calle argues. \\nLemos is quieter, perhaps because he is beginning to be named \\nfor the vice presidential spot in Julio Cesar Sanchez\\'s \\nproposal, the key to a \"winning team\" with Samper. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\nBFN \\n\\n  [Text] Warsaw, June 20 -- The Democratic Left Alliance \\n(SLD) won Sunday\\'s local elections in most cities, according to \\npreliminary results collected by the Polish press agency PAP. \\nThe SLD won most local council seats in 17 provincial capitals: \\nLodz, Kalisz, Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Radom, Kielce, Szczecin, \\nKoszalin, Slupsk, Bydgoszcz, Suwalki, Ciechanow, Zielona Gora, \\nPlock, Ostroleka, Legnica, and Sieradz. Centre-right coalitions \\nwon in Bialystok, Lomza, Rzeszow, Krosno, Siedlce, and Lublin, \\nwhile the Freedom Union and related coalitions came first in \\nWarsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Wroclaw, Krakow and Bielsko-Biala. The \\nPolish Peasant Party (PSL) won single seats in several cities \\nbut it is expected to win more seats in the countryside. \\nBy-elections to the Senate brought victory to candidates of the \\nSLD and PSL. The election turnout has been estimated at 35.8 per \\ncent, head of the State Electoral Commission Wojciech Laczkowski \\nannounced. This estimate is based on data from 36 provinces. \\nOfficial results are expected at the end of this week. \\n  The turnout was higher in the countryside (38.5 per cent) \\nthan in towns (29.2 per cent). The highest turnout was recorded \\nin the Leszno and Poznan Provinces, 43 and 42 per cent \\nrespectively. The lowest turnout occurred in Lomza (23 per \\ncent) and Gorzow (24 per cent). \"Low turnout does not mean a \\ncrisis of the local government idea. A conflict with a village \\nhead may be a reason for people not to go to the polls. At the \\nsame time, turnout may be very high in a neighbouring commune,\" \\nsaid head of the National Election Bureau Kazimierz Czaplicki. \\nCzaplicki added said that the 36 per cent turnout was low but \\nnot discrediting. He said that local elections in other \\ncountries often attract moderate attention among the electorate, \\nfor example, 25 per cent in the United States, 39 in Hungary, \\nand 40 in Britain. \\n  Secretary-general of the Social Democracy of the Republic of \\nPoland (SDRP) Jerzy Szmajdzinski told Mondays press conference \\nthat according to the estimates of the SLD it has increased ten \\ntimes the number of local council members. He contended the \\nresult was satisfactory, which indicates that the SLD was the \\nmain leftist force. He said that the election results mean that \\nsociety favours the implementation of a normal political \\ntimetable, with no accelerations. In Szmajdzinski\\'s opinion, the \\nSLD won 30 per cent of votes in 29 cities, following up their \\nSeptember 19 parliamentary election result. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nApril 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MUNICIPAL PRIMARY; \\n\\n\\nL.A. ELECTION IS DULLSVILLE AT PRECINCTS AS FEW TURN OUT \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy 7 a.m. Tuesday, the Wileys, mother and daughter, and their neighbors, also a \\nmother and daughter, were prepared for a special occasion. \\n\\n\\nThey sat in a row behind a folding table in their room at the Elegant Manor \\nSocial Center, a half-timbered mansion on West Adams Boulevard available for \\nweddings and dances. Hot coffee, peanuts and corn chips had been set out. An \\nAmerican flag hung outside the door. \\n\\n\\nThe four women were giving an election. But none of the guests had appeared. \\n\\n\\n\"We had nothing else to do,\" said Gwen Wiley (the daughter). \"So we said, \\'We \\nmight as well vote.\\' \" \\n\\n\\nFive hours later, only 32 more of the precinct\\'s 300 voters had come by. Wiley \\nlooked at her mother Ruth\\'s watch and yawned. \\n\\n\\n\"High noon,\" she said. \"Eight more hours to go.\" \\n\\n\\nAcross the city, the scene was similarly quiet in the school auditoriums and \\nauto dealerships, churches and synagogues, fraternity houses, garages and sun \\nporches that become polling places on Election Day. \\n\\n\\nFew Los Angeles residents were lured by the opportunity to vote for mayor, city \\nattorney and representatives for City Council, school and community college \\nboards or to decide on six ballot propositions. By 7 p.m., only 18.3% of the \\nvoters in a city clerk\\'s sampling of 75 precincts had cast ballots. \\n\\n\\nPrecinct judges and inspectors said municipal elections always have lighter \\nturnouts than elections with federal and state races on the ballot. But even \\ntaking that into account, the showing was skimpy. \\n\\n\\nSome election workers blamed the mist and drizzle, others the lack of \\nexcitement in the various contests. \\n\\n\\nPrecinct judge Barbara Grunner blamed the candidates themselves. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s their fault,\" she said as she sat in front of a gold 1934 Oldsmobile at a \\nMission Hills car showroom and watched four empty cardboard polling booths. \\n\"They didn\\'t have debates. A lot of issues could have been brought up.\" \\n\\n\\nEven some of the precinct workers decided not to vote. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not interested in this,\" said Melanie Mullins, a 26-year-old precinct \\njudge at Charles Maclay Junior High School in Pacoima. \"I\\'m just not.\" \\n\\n\\nMany of the voters who did arrive at the polls said they came to show their \\nreverence for the electoral process. \\n\\n\\nJoe Harris, for example, pulled his right ear forward to reveal a small, thin \\nscar. \\n\\n\\n\"I came because of this,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nA Nashville, Tenn., policeman\\'s club inflicted the scar in 1963 when Harris was \\nregistering blacks to vote, he said. As soon as Harris was old enough to vote \\nin 1964, he did so. He is 47 now, and \"I haven\\'t missed one since,\" he said \\noutside the Mid-Wilshire wedding chapel that served as his precinct Tuesday. \\n\\n\\nWillie Cook, a retired city street maintenance worker, likewise votes every \\ntime he is eligible. \\n\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s my duty as a citizen,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nHe tries to be first at his Pacoima precinct every year. This time, he was \\nlate: No. 6. But as in the past, he saved his stub to carry with him for a \\nwhile and then add to the collection in his dresser drawer. \\n\\n\\nCora Lee Johnson votes out of habit. When she lived in Kansas City decades ago, \\nshe learned to cast a ballot each election \"because if you didn\\'t vote, they\\'d \\nvote your name for you.\" She can remember people approaching the polls there \\nand forgetting who they were supposed to be. \\n\\n\\nIn some cases, it was discontent that drew voters to the polls. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m tired of Tom Bradley and all of his friends,\" said Lindy Willingham, a \\nSherman Oaks free-lance paralegal. \". . . I think that the city\\'s going to pot. \\nThe other issues are no big deal.\" \\n\\n\\nShe said she voted for former county Supervisor Baxter Ward for mayor over \\nBradley. \\n\\n\\nDiana Zajac, who voted near the Westside Pavilion in Rancho Park, said she \\nwanted Laura Lake to replace Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. Lake had attacked \\nYaroslavsky for letting the shopping center and other developments be built in \\nhis 5th District. \\n\\n\\n\"I think Zev\\'s a little burned out,\" Zajac said. \\n\\n\\nStill, the loyalists were out. Jim Burley, who voted at Elegant Manor, said he \\nremembers when Bradley was a police officer on the beat. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been knowing him a long time,\" Burley, 59, said. \"It\\'s true he hasn\\'t \\ndone much for his people, but we don\\'t want Nate Holden. He was up north (in \\nSacramento as a state senator) for years, and he didn\\'t do nothing either.\" \\n\\n\\nMix-ups made the day more exciting at about half a dozen precincts that opened \\nlate, said Joseph Giles, who heads the city clerk\\'s election division. At a \\nHollywood elementary school, voters said about 45 people were turned away \\nbecause the precinct inspector was home sick. After angry residents called City \\nHall to complain, the site opened at 11 a.m. Another precinct in a private home \\nwas late opening because the owner was on vacation. \\n\\n\\nAt one polling place, in a Tarzana garage, election workers were elated when \\nmore than 30% of their voters cast ballots. \\n\\n\\n\"What you have here is a very civic-minded area,\" said Manny Bernstein, who \\nowns the precinct site, \"except when it comes to volunteering your garage for \\nthe vote. Nobody else would do it.\" \\n\\n\\nBut at most of the 2,730 polling stations, the day was unrelievedly dull. \\n\\n\\nAt the Riddick Youth Center in Rancho Park, precinct workers ate oatmeal \\ncookies baked by a precinct judge\\'s wife. At Tete A Tete Hair & Nails in \\nSherman Oaks, the refreshments were pastries and coffee, and the entertainment \\nwas provided by precinct judge Lloyd Zimmer\\'s two children, who visited along \\nwith a friend. \\n\\n\\nBrenda Richards at Maclay came prepared with three mystery novels, a jug of \\nwater and a pack of cigarettes. \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll have plenty of time to do whatever we want,\" she said. \"Shop, knit, \\ncrochet, give birth to a baby. It\\'s a fun day.\" \\n\\n\\nDella R. Avila, a precinct judge in her home near USC, was not so sanguine. \\nOnly the day before, she had received a certificate from the county \\nregistrar-recorder\\'s office for her 30 years of election work. When the polls \\nclosed at 8 p.m., only 31 people in her precinct -- out of 880 registered -- \\nhad voted. \\n\\n\\n\"It took a minute to count the votes,\" she said. \"We even double-checked.\" \\n\\n\\nAlso contributing to Los Angeles election coverage were Roxane Arnold, Glenn F. \\nBunting, Alan Citron, David Colker, Alma Cook, Sam Enriquez, Paul Feldman, Gabe \\nFuentes, Larry Gordon, Charisse Jones, Tracey Kaplan, Amy Louise Kazmin, Daryl \\nKelley, Alan C.

The \\nresearch initiatives survey of 8,004 respondents shows 83 per \\ncent of black voters and 85 per cent of white voters intend \\ncasting ballots. However, only 50 per cent of coloureds and 55 \\nper cent of Indians intend voting. The survey shows six per \\ncent of blacks, eight per cent of whites, 19 per cent of \\ncoloureds and 23 per cent of Indians intend abstaining. \\n  Motivation to vote among blacks is highest in the Eastern \\nand \\nWestern Cape (93 and 95 per cent) and lowest in Natal and the \\nEastern Transvaal (74 per cent). Among coloureds, it is lowest \\nin the Western Cape (47 per cent) and in the North-West Region \\n(46 per cent). Indian voters in the PWV [Pretoria, \\nWitwatersrand, Vereeniging] region are more motivated than those \\nin Natal (62 and 54 per cent). \\n  Women are less motivated than men in all regions except the \\nWestern Cape.

Among \\nblacks, lack of identity documents is the fifth most important \\nreason for not voting. The survey also shows the secrecy of the \\nballot is either doubted or mistrusted by about 25 per cent of \\nvoters. Belief in ballot secrecy is highest among blacks, at 81 \\nper cent.

The participants fill 11,000 slots in more than 115 centers around \\nthe country. Southern California has 1,000 beds at 10 centers. \\n\\n\\nThe work falls under the Fair Labor Standards Act because the goods produced by \\nthe workers end up in interstate commerce, said Labor Department spokesman Bob \\nCuccia in Washington. \\n\\n\\nThe Army\\'s position is that participants in the program are \"beneficiaries,\" \\nnot employees with work being a part of the treatment protocol, much the way \\nmovie stars at the Betty Ford Center must take out the garbage. \\n\\n\\nThe Salvation Army was founded in 1865 as a religious and charitable \\norganization and is a branch of the Christian church that is run in a \\nquasi-military fashion. The church affiliation is another argument for not \\nhaving to pay wages to those in the rehabilitation programs. \\n\\n\\nThe Salvation Army is appealing the ruling to a higher authority. The group, a \\nnational institution for more than 100 years, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District \\nCourt in Alexandria, Va., on Tuesday challenging the decision. \\n\\n\\nThe local organization is also appealing to the court of public opinion, \\ninviting reporters on Wednesday to tour its 180-bed facility at 7th Street and \\nTowne Avenue downtown. \\n\\n\\nThere, Salvation Army officials and the men at work unloading trucks, packing \\nlunches and refinishing furniture for resale at the thrift stores, explained \\ntheir philosophies and beliefs. Officials said the ruling by the Wage and Hour \\nDivision of the Department of Labor is disastrous to the organization\\'s \\nself-supporting program and the people it serves. \\n\\n\\nThe wage issue has been kicking around since the first term of the Reagan \\nAdministration, according to an official on an appointed Labor Department \\ncommittee that recommended program workers be paid. \\n\\n\\nThe committee, chaired by the president of Goodwill Industries of America \\n\"urged us to take an enforcement stance,\" Cuccia said. \\n\\n\\nGoodwill, the Easter Seal Society and other similar organizations all pay wages \\nto their disabled workers, Cuccia said. \\n\\n\\nBut Army officials counter that if wages were paid, needy substance abusers \\nwould be out on the street because the Army would have to charge for the \\ntreatment program and nearly all participants cannot afford to pay. \\n\\n\\nSalvation Army Lt. Col. David P. Riley said the program costs about $50 a day \\nper person to run. The \"beneficiaries\" receive a stipend of up to $20 a month \\nfor candy and cigarettes. To give them more would be \"a very damaging practice\" \\nbecause those with substance abuse problems would take the money and run, said \\nRiley. \\n\\n\\nRiley insisted that as long as the people are \"working their treatment program\" \\n-- a combination of spiritualism, Tough Love for adults and an Alcoholics \\nAnonymous-type 12-step program -- they are not being exploited. \\n\\n\\nSeveral current residents interviewed while at work espoused a similar view. \"I \\ndidn\\'t come here to acquire a job. I came here to get myself back in society,\" \\nsaid George Upsey as he popped packets of mustard into sack lunches. \\n\\n\\nUpsey, 40, a college graduate who majored in biology and chemistry, said he is \\nan alcoholic who would not be in the program if it cost money. \\n\\n\\nOut on the loading dock, a 28-year-old self-described cocaine addict, Michael \\nLawrence, said a paycheck would be fair, but \"it\\'s not what I\\'m looking for. \\nI\\'m looking for help.\" \\n\\n\\nWayne Diviak, 51, who has been in the rehabilitation program more than once, \\nwas stripping the finish from a table as he explained he doesn\\'t feel taking \\nadvantage of what he calls \"work therapy.\" \\n\\n\\nOr as Riley puts it, they\\'re learning the \"work ethic.\" \\n\\n\\nNot everyone agrees with the Salvation\\'s Army\\'s approach.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 4, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWALK-A-THON MONEY AND SALVATION ARMY \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBen Young\\'s fine letter \"In Behalf of the Salvation Army\" (July 20) quite \\nrightly reminds readers of the loving, steadfast and effective efforts that \\n\"army\" conducts for those in need. \\n\\n\\nOne comment however, may call for clarification. It\\'s the rueful mention that \\nthe Salvation Army is not on the receiving list for sharing proceeds of the San \\nFernando Valley Board of Realtors\\' annual Walk-a-thon for the Valley Homeless. \\n\\n\\nThese proceeds go to the Valley Mayors\\' Fund for the Homeless, which selects \\nthose service-providers it deems appropriate to help, and decides how large a \\nportion of the money raised should go to each agency. It\\'s a heavy \\nresponsibility, and one of the Valley Mayors\\' Fund takes seriously. Most \\nhomeless-helping groups in the San Fernando Valley were formed in the last few \\nyears, to cope with this recent social phenomenon\\'s needs. Few if any are \\nsoundly funded, and all spend much of their needed energies on raising funds \\njust to stay open, to meet their mortgage or rent payments, their utility bills \\nand payrolls, in order to keep on serving the dispossessed among us in whatever \\nways they can. \\n\\n\\nThe Salvation Army is easily the longest established and best known of all such \\nagencies, and as such, (besides being one branch of a nationwide organization), \\ncan expect reliable funding for its work, since the general public knows, \\nadmires and trusts it, with good reason. \\n\\n\\nAnd so, at decision time, Valley Mayors\\' Fund chooses to disburse Walk-a-thon \\nproceeds among those other agencies in far greater need of funds. The wonderful \\nWalk-a-thon walkers and all their sponsors, whose pledged donations amount to \\nthe total raised, can be proud that their exertions and dollars have literally \\nsaved some of these service-providers from having to close their doors. \\n\\n\\nRemarkably, there is very little competing among these groups. Instead, they \\nmeet regularly, exchange their progress and problems, network and help each \\nother however they can. And where does this Valley-wide Coalition on the \\nHomeless meet? Why, at Salvation Army\\'s Community Center! \\n\\n\\nIn wintertime, Valley Mayors\\' Fund collects and buys blankets for Valley people \\nwithout any kind of shelter, and each year has turned over blankets beyond \\ncounting, to the Salvation Army and other groups, for direct distribution. We \\nare all caring private citizens and co-workers who have become fond friends, \\ntoiling together toward a Valley where no one need suffer. \\n\\n\\nMARSHA HUNT \\n\\n\\nSherman Oaks \\n\\n\\n Hunt is honorary mayor of Sherman Oaks and founder of the Valley Mayor\\'s Fund. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

It\\'s an army that bangs its drums and \\nblows its instruments to glorify God and not its work in His behalf. \\n\\n\\nHowever, for the encouragement of the tens of thousands of generous and loyal \\nsupporters of the army in the San Fernando Valley, this letter is just a word \\nto remind them of certain facts. \\n\\n\\nEvery night of the year a minimum of 140 men (who would otherwise be homeless, \\nand who are homeless when they come to us) are sleeping in clean beds in the \\nSalvation Army\\'s two Adult Rehabilitation Centers here in the Valley: 85 of \\nthem in the Van Nuys center and 55 in Canoga Park. \\n\\n\\nEvery week over 300 men, women and children who are homeless are provided with \\nemergency food at the army\\'s San Fernando Valley Corps Community Center on \\nVictory Boulevard in Van Nuys. While emergency shelter is very limited in the \\nValley for adult men and women, the army is committed before God never to turn \\naway a homeless child. Of the center\\'s $500,000 budget for 1989-90, \\napproximately $25,000 will be received from the United Way. We expect to spend \\nevery cent of that amount on motel rooms for homeless children and their \\nparents for one, two or three nights. \\n\\n\\nAn additional 300-plus individuals who are not homeless but almost equally \\ndesperate are also helped with food and clothing at the Victory Boulevard \\nCenter every week. \\n\\n\\nThe \"Good Samaritan van\" driven by volunteers and stocked with 15 gallons of \\ngood nourishing homemade soup, 300-plus sandwiches, toilet articles and \\nblankets (when we have them) goes out every Friday evening and visits the \\nhomeless in North Hollywood Park, Hansen Dam and the United Way building in Van \\nNuys. We\\'ve been going out for over four years now, and every week we serve a \\nminimum of 100 men and women. \\n\\n\\nEvery Sunday evening at least 100 homeless gather in the Victory Boulevard \\nCenter at 4 p.m. for a rousing Christian Worship service and a home-cooked \\ndinner which is served at 5.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFESTIVE SOVIET CEREMONY MARKS AFGHAN WITHDRAWAL \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Soviet Union marked its military withdrawal from Afghanistan on Monday with \\na festive if premature ceremony characterized more by a sense of relief than of \\ntriumph or satisfaction. \\n\\n\\nA battalion of 300 paratroopers who had left their base near Kabul three days \\nearlier rolled onto Soviet territory on the north bank of the Amu Darya River \\nat 11:37 a.m. local time, marking the beginning of the withdrawal\\'s final \\nphase. \\n\\n\\nAs they crossed the Friendship Bridge linking the two countries here in Termez, \\nthey passed a billboard bearing the message, \"The Soviet Armed Forces Are a \\nSchool of Hardening and Courage.\" \\n\\n\\nBut for all the talk of the army having fulfilled its \"internationalist duty\" \\nin nine years of propping up the revolution in Afghanistan, the highest-ranking \\nofficial on hand for Monday\\'s ceremonies was a deputy premier from the Soviet \\nrepublic of Uzbekistan -- the rough equivalent of a lieutenant governor in the \\nUnited States. \\n\\n\\n\"If we\\'d had glasnost in 1979, we\\'d never have gone in,\" one army veteran said, \\nreferring to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev\\'s policy of openness. \\n\\n\\nGorbachev has referred to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, which began \\nin December, 1979, as one of the sins of the past that the leadership is now \\ntrying to expunge. Many among the men coming home would agree with him. \\n\\n\\n\"The problem was that nobody supported us,\" an officer said, speaking on \\ncondition of anonymity. \"If the (Afghan) people had supported us, we could have \\nwon.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Soviets are withdrawing under the terms of the April, 1988, Geneva \\nagreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The United States and the Soviet \\nUnion are acting as official guarantors of the agreement. \\n\\n\\nMoscow pledged to remove all its forces from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, and 50,000 \\nwere pulled out last summer under the first phase of the agreement. An army \\nspokesman said Monday that 30,000 have been withdrawn in recent weeks, \\napparently leaving only about 20,000 still south of the border. \\n\\n\\nThe army spokesman said Soviet troops are still present in only five of \\nAfghanistan\\'s 26 provinces, mostly in the northern part of the country. \\n\\n\\nMoscow does not count an unspecified number of advisers reportedly being left \\nbehind to help the pro-Soviet government in Kabul fight off the rebel \\nmoujahedeen, who are supported by the United States. \\n\\n\\nWashington and Moscow continue to supply weapons to the opposing sides in the \\nAfghan conflict. \\n\\n\\nNearly 200 Soviet and foreign correspondents were permitted to come to this \\nnormally closed border town to observe Monday\\'s ceremony. Officials along the \\nway have gone to considerable length to discourage any comparison between the \\nwithdrawal from Afghanistan and the American withdrawal from Vietnam. \\n\\n\\n\"Absolutely no analogy exists between Vietnam and Afghanistan,\" Uzbek Foreign \\nMinister Sattar A. Azimov said at a press conference in the republic\\'s capital \\nof Tashkent. \\n\\n\\nMaj. Gen. Valery P. Stripnin, deputy chief of the political department of the \\nSoviet Central Asian command, said: \"Soviet troops are getting out of \\nAfghanistan not because they suffered a defeat but because of a new situation \\nand new approaches to the problem of (Afghan) national unity.\" \\n\\n\\nThe army concedes that the war has cost at least 13,000 Soviet lives. More than \\n35,000 other Soviet soldiers were wounded, and 311 are missing in action. \\n\\n\\nThe war became increasingly unpopular at home and cost the Kremlin dearly in \\nterms of foreign relations. \\n\\n\\nNow, Lt. Alexander Smirnov said, \"Afghans will sort out their own problems.\" \\nSmirnov carried an Afghan flag in Monday\\'s ceremony as a mark of continuing \\nSoviet friendship for the country, he said. \\n\\n\\n\"We just hope that what we did will not be wasted,\" said Pvt. Georgi Bulat, 20. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmphasis on the Present \\n\\n\\nAbout 3,000 dignitaries, townspeople and relatives were on hand to greet the \\nreturning troops, and they seemed to be more eager to enjoy the present than to \\nreflect on the past or ponder the future. \\n\\n\\nOn one side of the parade ground were stands selling such normally \"deficit\" \\nconsumer goods as toothpaste, bars of hand soap and nylon stockings. \\n\\n\\nEarly birds lunched on freshly grilled shish kebab, chicken and fish. A local \\nbakery supplied cakes decorated with multicolored frosting. \\n\\n\\nThe paratroop battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. Alexander Skachkov, 39, an \\n18-year veteran from Smolensk, took five minutes to cross the Friendship Bridge \\nin a fast-moving convoy of 64 vehicles. \\n\\n\\nThe troopers, mostly draftees 19 or 20 years old and from virtually every part \\nof the country, waved and smiled as their flag-bedecked vehicles rolled past \\nSoviet and Western television cameras. \\n\\n\\nSome of the vehicles had the name of the driver\\'s hometown scrawled on them, \\nand many were draped with red-and-white propaganda banners. One announced that \\n\"We Fulfilled the Order of the Motherland.\" \\n\\n\\nThe vehicles were parked in four columns on a huge parade ground, and the men \\ndismounted to form up in review. \\n\\n\\n\"The battalion, having performed its internationalist duty, has come home,\" Lt. \\nCol. Skachkov reported to the assembled crowd. Then he congratulated his troops \\nfor their service. \\n\\n\\nTwo 19-year-old Uzbek women from Termez, dressed in native costume, gave \\nSkachkov the traditional welcome of bread and salt, and schoolgirls presented \\nhim with flowers. \\n\\n\\nA military band played the national anthem, and Deputy Uzbek Premier Valery V. \\nSudarenkov told the troops that they had passed their test with flying colors. \\nHe said they deserved the gratitude of the Afghan and Soviet people. \\n\\n\\nThey had returned, he said, to a country in the midst of profound change, and \\nhe added, \"We want you to join the front ranks of the fighters for the \\nrevolutionary transformation of our society.\" \\n\\n\\nAs the official welcoming ceremony wound down, people from the crowd were \\npermitted onto the parade ground. They gave the soldiers flowers, balloons, \\nbread and sweets. \\n\\n\\nSeveral soldiers put the flowers in the muzzles of their rifles or the big guns \\nmounted on their vehicles. Then they roared off in a dusty farewell. \\n\\n\\nFor Pvt. Normund Skutelis, a Latvian, it was one more step toward getting back \\nto civilian life.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nONE OF \\'OUR OLD SINS\\'; \\n\\n\\nSOVIETS DEBATE LESSONS OF FAILED AFGHAN POLICY \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the last few thousand Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan, they are returning \\nto a warm welcome from a relieved nation happy to have them home, but also to a \\ngrowing political controversy over the nine-year war. \\n\\n\\n\"Our boys are coming home,\" a Soviet television commentator said over the \\nweekend, summing up the universal satisfaction both at the troops\\' return and \\nat the knowledge that by Wednesday, the country will finally be out of an \\nunwinnable and increasingly unpopular war. \\n\\n\\n\"Hello, Motherland!\" the government newspaper Izvestia said in a headline over \\none of its front-page reports on the withdrawal last week. \"We\\'ve Waited for \\nThis for Nine Years,\" another front-page headline declared. \\n\\n\\nEach evening, Soviet Television shows more tanks, armored personnel carriers \\nand trucks full of troops crossing the border from Afghanistan into Soviet \\nCentral Asia. Their clear joy is infectious as the cameras focus on the \\nlong-awaited family reunions and then on the on-the-spot demobilization of many \\nsoldiers. \\n\\n\\nAnd, like his troops, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov -- the Soviet commander in \\nAfghanistan -- will cross Friendship Bridge linking the Soviet town of Termez \\nwith Hayratan on the Afghan side \"without looking back,\" a correspondent for \\nthe Soviet youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported. \\n\\n\\nExpected to be the last Soviet soldier to leave Afghanistan on Wednesday, the \\ndeadline for completion of the withdrawal of the 100,300 troops who were there \\nwhen the pullout began nine months ago, Gromov will pause only for a minute or \\nso to reflect on the long war, the paper said, and then he, too, \"will have \\nreturned to the warm embrace of the motherland.\" \\n\\n\\nAlthough there are few emotions deeper than the joy of a homecoming for a \\nRussian, the Soviet troops are returning to a growing and increasingly bitter \\npolitical debate over whose mistake it was to invade Afghanistan in late 1979 \\nand then to stay nine years, fighting on behalf of a government now perceived \\nas largely without popular support. \\n\\n\\nOne of \"our old sins,\" President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called it during a speech \\nhere last month -- only to change the characterization two days later, when his \\nremarks were published, to a criticism of the \"considerable expenditures\" \\ninvolved in the war. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNearly 15,000 Killed \\n\\n\\nWith nearly 15,000 Soviet personnel reported killed, huge resources wasted and \\nthe country\\'s international prestige badly damaged in the war, this political \\nsensitivity stems first from the question of responsibility. \\n\\n\\nThe late President Leonid I. Brezhnev is officially being blamed for this and \\nmost of the country\\'s other political, economic and social ills. But with its \\nprinciple of collective leadership, the Communist Party, which repeatedly \\nendorsed the Afghanistan action as in the finest traditions of the \\ninternational Communist movement, is being pressed now to acknowledge the war \\nfully and formally as a fundamental error. \\n\\n\\nAs party members seek election next month to the new Congress of People\\'s \\nDeputies, Afghanistan is an issue on which they are frequently challenged as \\nthey assert the correctness of perestroika, the political, economic and social \\nrestructuring begun by Gorbachev in 1984. \\n\\n\\n\"Why has it taken nearly four years under Gorbachev, under perestroika, to \\ncomplete our withdrawal?\" a trade union delegate demanded of a party official \\nduring a nomination meeting here last week. \"Even now, with almost all of our \\nboys back home, why can\\'t you say we were wrong to go in? Why do you still say \\nit was our \\'internationalist duty\\' to defend a government and a party that were \\nnever socialist and came to power through a coup d\\'etat?\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCracks Are Showing \\n\\n\\nThe party is still grappling with such questions itself, and, amid the \\ncontinuing political ferment here, the divisions are increasingly apparent. \\n\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, it has taken nearly 10 years,\" Alexander Bovin, a leading \\nSoviet commentator, said recently of the decision to withdraw. \"It took \\nthousands of deaths, enormous materials costs, a fall in our country\\'s prestige \\nand the exacerbation of the international atmosphere to understand -- to \\nunderstand not in theory, but in practice -- that every people has to decide \\nits own fate itself, without outside interference. \\n\\n\\n\"This conclusion is drawn not because we proved powerless to change the natural \\ncourse of events in another country. This conclusion is drawn because the very \\nattempt to change that course of events was mistaken in principle.\" \\n\\n\\nBovin, whose sharp criticism has been cut several times from television \\ncommentaries, acknowledged that many, particularly those who fought in \\nAfghanistan, find it difficult to accept this view, which contradicts past \\nideals of \"internationalist duty\" and \"fraternal assistance.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBitter Truth \\n\\n\\n\"The bitter truth is all the same better and more useful than an \\'elevating \\ndeception,\\' \" he remarked, adding that blame did not lie with \"the officers and \\nmen who fought in Afghanistan and were true to their oath and fulfilled their \\nsoldierly duty\" but with those who made the political decision. \\n\\n\\nThe Afghan war was never popular, but it was not the central and highly \\nemotional issue here that the Vietnam War became in American politics. The \\nSoviet political system permitted little debate until recently, and the scale \\nof Soviet involvement in Afghanistan was only one-fifth that of the United \\nStates in Vietnam. \\n\\n\\n\"Putting aside the differences we see in the origins of U.S. intervention in \\nVietnam and our involvement in Afghanistan -- and we think they are quite \\nsignificant differences, starting with the fact that Afghanistan was a \\nneighboring country with a socialist government -- the war was kept remote from \\nour people,\" a senior Soviet editor commented last week, asking not to be \\nquoted by name. \\n\\n\\n\"The commitment of our forces was much, much less than those the U.S. deployed \\nin Vietnam, our casualties were kept secret, the costs of the war were never \\ndisclosed and our press always treated the Afghan conflict in heroic terms as \\npart of our internationalist duty as Communists.\" \\n\\n\\nNevertheless, a survey of 1,000 Muscovites in December showed that 61% of the \\nrespondents thought the decision to send troops into Afghanistan was wrong; 22% \\nbelieved that it was correct. \\n\\n\\nWith glasnost, the opening of political discussion that came as an important \\npart of Gorbachev\\'s broader reforms, the Soviet news media began in late 1987 \\nto give a more accurate picture of what the Afghan war was like -- both its \\nfailure to achieve the stated goal of a flourishing socialist state and what \\nthe Soviet soldiers sent there on 18-month tours were going through in a \\nparticularly cruel conflict. \\n\\n\\n\"For years and years, we had a war in which our soldiers never died and rarely \\neven bled,\" Leonid Mironov, who covered the start of the war for the Communist \\nParty newspaper Pravda, commented during a discussion on the war here this \\nmonth. \"It must have seemed like a war without casualties, without costs . . . \\na war that we could only win and in which we had only heroes. Maybe that is one \\nreason why it went on for so long.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneva Accords \\n\\n\\nOnly when the decision was made last year to pull out under an agreement signed \\nApril 15 in Geneva by Afghanistan and Pakistan -- with the United States and \\nthe Soviet Union as guarantors -- did it become possible to question why Moscow \\nhad intervened in 1979. \\n\\n\\nMironov, who believes strongly that the war was \"wrong from the beginning,\" \\nspeculated that the Soviet leadership -- the party and the military alike -- \\nwanted to show the West, particularly the United States, the Red Army\\'s combat \\nability and Moscow\\'s determination to advance socialism in developing \\ncountries. \\n\\n\\nBut Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov, another of the top Soviet commanders in \\nAfghanistan, replied: \"Yes, we made mistakes! But everything we did there, and \\nI stress that everything we did, was for the sake of the Afghan people!\" \\n\\n\\nSerebrov, who was in Afghanistan for the first three years of the war and then \\nreturned about a year ago for a final tour, also said he could not quarrel with \\nthe Soviet leadership\\'s initial decision to intervene. History would have to \\njudge the correctness of their action, he said, adding, \"We are still too close \\nto events.\" \\n\\n\\nUnlike the bitter debate in the United States over the Vietnam War, which \\ncontinued undiminished long after the protests erupted, the importance of this \\ntough political give and take lies in its implications for perestroika, for \\nfundamental change in the Soviet Union, and not for Afghanistan\\'s future. \\n\\n\\n\"We all -- the party and the people -- need a stern, hard, man-to-man talk \\nabout the lessons of Afghanistan,\" Bovin said in a December television \\ncommentary that was censored but later published in the highly influential, \\nmass circulation political weekly Arguments and Facts. \"We need the truth. I \\nwould like to hear the opinions and assessments of the main figures -- \\nhigh-ranking party officials, the military, the diplomats. \\n\\n\\n\"In the past -- I mean the conflict with Yugoslavia in 1948, the events in \\nHungary in 1956 and the troops sent into Czechoslovakia in 1968 -- we were too \\nlenient with ourselves. Nowadays, in the years of perestroika, we cannot permit \\nthis. The mistakes for which we are paying in blood, in the prestige of the \\nparty and socialism and with the people\\'s money, must not be repeated.\" The \\neventual judgment will inevitably reflect the outcome of events in Afghanistan \\nover the next few months -- and Soviet officials seem neither optimistic nor \\ntoo concerned. \\n\\n\\nAssessing the present situation, the government newspaper Izvestia suggested \\nSunday that hundreds of thousands of people could die as the civil war \\nintensifies. \\n\\n\\n\"Afghans of opposing political persuasions have been left confronting each \\nother,\" the paper said, adding that the moujahedeen, the Muslim rebels who \\noppose the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, are \"thirsting for blood.\" \\n\\n\\n\"The future holds the prospects of tens and even hundreds of thousands of \\ndeaths, which could have been avoided by the show of the most elementary good \\nwill and political reason,\" Izvestia said, lamenting the failure of final \\nSoviet diplomatic efforts to pull together a political settlement. \\n\\n\\nSoviet advisers are no more optimistic. Although Gromov said last week that \\nAfghan government forces had all of the arms, equipment, ammunition and other \\nsupplies they need to fight off the expected moujahedeen attacks and then go on \\nthe offensive themselves, many majors and captains doubt the Afghans\\' ability \\nto use the equipment and, more importantly, their will to fight. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment Left Behind \\n\\n\\n\"We have left fine equipment, but they will have enormous problems using it, \\nmaintaining it, repairing it, even firing it,\" a Soviet army major said in an \\ninterview over Radio Moscow this weekend. \"They have no experience, they have a \\npoor base of skills and knowledge and they have very low morale.\" \\n\\n\\nSoviet officials are now reassuring the country, as well as outsiders, that \\nafter Wednesday their troops will be out of Afghanistan, not to return. \\n\\n\\nWhile Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned that Moscow will continue \\nto supply arms and other materiel to the Kabul government if the fighting \\ncontinues, Soviet spokesmen have repeatedly declared that there will be no \\nfurther military support, such as air strikes, to help the government forces. \\n\\n\\nThe supply of food, medicine and other essentials will continue. Up to 40 large \\nSoviet cargo planes are transporting nearly 700 tons of supplies to Kabul each \\nday in an airlift from Tashkent in Soviet Central Asia. Air drops are beginning \\nto other towns. And final repairs are being made on the pipelines that carry \\nfuel from the Soviet border to Kabul. \\n\\n\\nBut fewer than 6,000 troops now remain, according to a Radio Moscow broadcast \\non Sunday, and most of those are on the way out by convoy. The last major \\ncontingent to leave -- aside from an embassy of 200 people and several hundred \\nofficers advising the Afghan army -- will be the 500 soldiers guarding Kabul \\nairport and the column led by Gen.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSOVIETS HEDGE ON FEB. 15 AFGHAN PULLOUT DATE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Soviet Union warned Tuesday that it might delay the withdrawal of its \\ntroops from Afghanistan beyond Feb. 15, the date by which it had agreed to \\ncomplete the pullout. \\n\\n\\nWord of this possibility came from Yuli M. Vorontsov, a first deputy Soviet \\nforeign minister and the Kremlin\\'s Afghanistan trouble-shooter, who returned to \\nMoscow after touring the region. He met with officials of Pakistan and Iran and \\nofficials of the rebel forces fighting the Afghan government. \\n\\n\\nSoviet troops invaded Afghanistan in late 1979 in an effort to prop up a \\npro-Soviet government. As part of U.N.-mediated accords signed last year in \\nGeneva, the Soviets agreed to remove the troops, estimated at 115,000, in \\nstages. About 50,000 were withdrawn last year, and the withdrawal was to be \\ncomplete by Feb. 15. \\n\\n\\nVorontsov told a news conference Tuesday in Moscow that it is too early to set \\nup a firm schedule for removing the last of the troops because of continued \\nrebel attacks on Afghan government forces and the unresolved issue of a \\npolitical settlement. \\n\\n\\nThe Soviets and the Afghan government say their troops have honored a \\ncease-fire since Jan. 1. \\n\\n\\nVorontsov, referring to the Geneva agreement, said there is \"a serious danger \\nthat things might shape up so that the Soviet Union will be unable to do what \\nthe Soviet Union agreed to do as a matter of principle.\" \\n\\n\\nAny delay in the withdrawal would be extremely unpopular in the Soviet Union. \\n\\n\\nIn Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, \"We still expect \\nthem to meet the deadline.\" \\n\\n\\n\"We have seen the same kind of statements over the last several months, going \\nas far back as September and October (and) during the meeting President Reagan \\nhad with (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev in New York,\" Fitzwater added. \\n\"They have continually raised these concerns because of the situation there. \\nBut we simply want to hold them to their commitment.\" \\n\\n\\nState Department spokesman Charles Redman said, \"There\\'s certainly no reason \\nthat they can\\'t be out by Feb. 15. Their withdrawal has resumed, for some days \\nnow. So, as a consequence, we certainly expect them to be out.\" \\n\\n\\nResponding to Vorontsov\\'s complaints about U.S. aid to the guerrillas, Redman \\nsaid U.S. policy remains that Washington will back the rebels for as long as \\nMoscow supplies the Afghan army. \\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, news agency reports from Pakistan on Tuesday quoted Western \\ndiplomats as saying the Soviets appeared to be making withdrawal preparations. \\n\\n\\nThe reports said that for the past week, there have been night-time departures \\nof Soviet aircraft from Kabul, the Afghan capital, that the Soviet military \\nhospital has been closed and that almost all of the Soviet military advisers \\nhave left. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

At that time, however, the moujahedeen \\nwere engaged in hit-and-run attacks on the withdrawing Soviet troops. Redman \\nraised the issue again Tuesday to underline the American position. \\n\\n\\nMichael H. Armacost, acting secretary of state, raised the Afghan issue with \\nSoviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin during a meeting at the State Department on \\nMonday. \\n\\n\\nThe Soviet Union has maintained that its operations are in response to attacks \\nby the moujahedeen on the Soviet-backed Kabul regime and, as such, are not \\nprohibited by the Geneva accords. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKabul Combat Reduced \\n\\n\\nWestern diplomats in Islamabad, Pakistan, quoted by United Press International, \\nconfirmed that the rebels are maintaining a low profile to allow the remainder \\nof the Soviet soldiers to leave the country. \\n\\n\\nThe envoys said that combat around Kabul has decreased in recent weeks. \\nHowever, diplomatic missions in the capital are making plans for a speedy \\nevacuation in case security breaks down after the departure of the Soviet \\ntroops. \\n\\n\\nThe West German Embassy closed down last week. A Western diplomat said three \\nEastern European embassies are also preparing to close. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. Embassy to Stay Open \\n\\n\\nRedman said the U.S. Embassy will remain open despite the Bush Administration\\'s \\nwarning to American civilians to leave the country. \\n\\n\\n\"Our people have reason for being there,\" he said.

Gorbachev omitted any mention of the February commitment \\nduring his speech to the United Nations in December. \\n\\n\\nConcern over the deadline mounted after the breakdown of peace talks between \\nSoviet officials and Afghan resistance groups based in Pakistan. The rebels \\nsaid they would not meet again with the Soviets if the latter continued to \\ninsist on a role for the current Soviet-backed regime in Kabul in any future \\nAfghan government. \\n\\n\\nAfter the talks broke down, Yuli M. Vorontsov, the Kremlin\\'s trouble-shooter on \\nAfghan matters, said there was a danger that the Soviet Union would not be able \\nto meet its obligations under the Geneva accord. \\n\\n\\nReturning to Moscow last Tuesday after a tour of Afghanistan and the region, \\nVorontsov warned that the Feb. 15 pullout deadline was in jeopardy because of \\ncontinued rebel attacks on Afghan government forces and the unresolved issue of \\na political settlement. \\n\\n\\nSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who paid an unexpected visit to \\nKabul over the weekend, ended his trip by issuing a statement pledging to the \\nKabul government that the Soviets will \"not leave it in need.\" \\n\\n\\nA Tass news agency report on Shevardnadze\\'s visit noted that Afghan rebel \\ngroups are planning an economic blockade of the capital and that \"a shortage of \\nfood and fuel is felt in Kabul already now, and the situation is being \\naggravated by winter cold.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo Interference Allowed \\n\\n\\nSpeaking in an interview with the Afghan press agency, Shevardnadze was quoted \\nas saying that the Soviets will not permit the rebels to interfere with \\nMoscow\\'s obligations to supply the Kabul government \"despite all obstacles.\" \\n\\n\\n\"If a war is imposed on the Afghan government despite the common sense and \\nlogic of national interests, (the Soviet Union) will be forced to counter this \\nwith a force of arms, and it has this force,\" Shevardnadze told the official \\nBakhtar news agency. \"The present regime has every opportunity to withstand, \\nand in case the war goes on, the Soviet arms supplies will also be continued.\" \\n\\n\\nShevardnadze appeared to be lashing out at the United States and Pakistan, \\nwhich have supported the rebels, when he complained in the interview that the \\npeople \"who harangue most of all for the withdrawal of Soviet troops\" now \\nappear to be trying to prevent the pullback in order to justify their \\nassistance to the rebels. \\n\\n\\nShevardnadze and the Afghan government of President Najibullah expressed hope \\nthat the rebels would agree to terms for a peace settlement that would allow \\nthe participation of all the parties to the conflict in a future government. \\n\\n\\nIn a related development, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said that \\ntalks between the Soviet Union and the moujahedeen rebels are a positive \\ndevelopment and should be continued. \\n\\n\\n\"It is proper for the leaders of the Soviet Union to show their good faith and \\naccept the will of the Afghan nation in choosing their real representatives,\" \\nVelayati told a conference of rebel leaders in Tehran. \\n\\n\\nThe Soviets have so far withdrawn about 50,000 troops from Afghanistan and are \\nexpected to pull out the remaining 55,000 between now and the deadline. Western \\ndiplomats in Kabul have reported a sharp increase in the number of military \\ntransports leaving the capital at night, as well as the closure of the Soviet \\nmilitary hospital in Kabul. \\n\\n\\nThe Soviet Union invaded the country in 1979 and had as many as 115,000 troops \\nthere at the height of its involvement. The lengthy conflict was a huge drain \\non Soviet economic resources, however, and mounting casualties provoked growing \\nopposition at home. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

It \\nsaid tensions had begun to rise as Soviet troops pulled out, just 10 days ahead \\nof the Feb. 15 deadline for withdrawal. \\n\\n\\nIn Kabul on Sunday, Najibullah told members of the ruling People\\'s Democratic \\nParty that his Marxist government will survive the rebel onslaught despite the \\nSoviet pullout after a decade-long occupation. \\n\\n\\n\"God is with us. The people are with us. We will win the war,\" Najibullah told \\nabout 10,000 party members who gathered in bitter cold near the presidential \\npalace. \\n\\n\\nThe crowd chanted \"Down with imperialism\" and brandished thousands of unloaded \\nKalashnikov assault rifles. \\n\\n\\nWeapons have been distributed among party organizations in Kabul \"so that every \\none of us could defend the cause,\" said Daud Razmyar, first secretary of the \\nKabul city committee of the ruling party. \\n\\n\\n\"The Russian armies are leaving the country, and we will defend ourselves,\" \\nsaid the 43-year-old Najibullah, dressed in combat fatigues. \"We have to be \\nstrong. We have to unite.\" \\n\\n\\nAs he spoke, more than a dozen Soviet transport planes streaked off in \\ndifferent directions, spewing flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles \\nused by the guerrillas. Artillery fire could be heard in the distance. \\n\\n\\nSoviet officials in Kabul said today that the last troop convoy left the \\ncapital Saturday. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that \\na battalion of about 1,000 Soviet soldiers will remain at the airport, on the \\noutskirts of the city, to assist the supply airlift into the capital.

REPORT DETAILS WAR\\'S HUMAN TOLL \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA U.N. report on the devastation caused by nine years of war in Afghanistan \\npaints a stark picture: \\n\\n\\nHerat province -- 600 of 1,300 villages \"seriously damaged or totally \\ndestroyed,\" 60% of all trees \"cut down for security reasons,\" 1,123 human limbs \\namputated in the past five years -- \"the great majority of the victims children \\nbelow 15 years\" -- because of anti-personnel mines, 400 primary schoolteachers \\nkilled, \"the majority of schools destroyed,\" agriculturalproduction \"down more \\nthan 50% from prewar levels.\" \\n\\n\\nKunar province -- \"Major war damage,\" \"majority of population has fled,\" roads \\nin \"appalling condition, many of them mined,\" pine forests \"stripped bare,\" \\neducation and health facilities \"non-existent,\" \"physical infrastructure . . . \\nbadly run down or destroyed.\" \\n\\n\\nPaktia province -- \"Health situation . . . critical, not a single doctor is \\npresent,\" \"all schools are closed, the teachers gone,\" \"mines scattered on \\nroads and in fields,\" agricultural output \"less than one-fourth prewar levels.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Soviet intervention in Afghanistan ended officially at 11:20 a.m. Wednesday \\nwhen Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov, commander of Soviet troops in Afghanistan, stepped \\nacross the border and back into the Soviet Union. A ceremony welcomed him as \\nthe last Soviet soldier to leave. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15,000 Soviets Dead \\n\\n\\nFor the Soviets, who lost 15,000 men killed and had tens of thousands of others \\nmaimed, it meant that the war was finally over. For Americans, who funneled \\nbillions of dollars in arms, ammunition and other supplies to the Islamic rebel \\nmovement that helped drive the Soviets out, it was a victory. \\n\\n\\nBut for the Afghans, there was no celebration Wednesday. \\n\\n\\n\"I talked to eight Afghans today, and not one of them mentioned the Soviet \\nwithdrawal,\" a Western diplomat in Pakistan said. \"Today is really an American \\nvictory. For the Afghans, the war still goes on.\" \\n\\n\\nThe regime of Afghan President Najibullah, installed and propped up by the \\nSoviets, is still in place. The cities, reeling under shortages of bread, fuel \\nand other necessities, are under siege by the Islamic guerrillas, who continue \\nto pummel them with rocket and mortar fire. The 31 largely rural provinces, \\nlike Kunar, Herat and Paktia, have been turned into a virtual wasteland, barely \\ncapable of supporting human life. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMillion Believed Killed \\n\\n\\nMore than a million Afghans are believed to have been killed. Five million \\nothers, a third of the population, are refugees in mud-walled camps scattered \\nover the border regions of Pakistan and Iran. And according to the U.N. survey, \\nthe 9 million Afghans still in the country face famine, epidemic and \\nstarvation. \\n\\n\\nDespite all the international attention focused on the impoverished country, \\nefforts to prepare it for peace are lagging seriously. The U.N. program for the \\nrehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan, announced last year, has \\nbogged down in diplomatic wrangling and charges of inefficiency and disorder in \\nthe agency set up to administer it. \\n\\n\\nAccording to diplomats representing donor nations, and according to independent \\naid workers and Pakistani officials in Peshawar, which has been Afghan refugee \\nheadquarters since the war began, Afghanistan is no better prepared for the end \\nof the war than it was nearly a year ago, when planning began. \\n\\n\\nFrom the U.N. effort to raise more than $1 billion in reconstruction funds to \\nthe crucial program to clear the many unexploded land mines and shells, the \\nproject has been plagued by delays and administrative problems, say senior \\ndiplomats and aid workers. Many fear this will delay the return of what is now \\nthe world\\'s largest refugee population. \\n\\n\\nPrince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who was appointed overall coordinator of the U.N. \\nprogram, conceded at a press conference here Sunday that since October he has \\nmanaged to raise just $238 million in cash donations towards the $1-billion \\nreconstruction program. \\n\\n\\nAn additional $650 million of in-kind contributions were pledged by the Soviet \\nUnion, but Sadruddin said the United Nations needs cash to feed the refugees \\nand build the roads, bridges, irrigation canals and houses they will need when \\nthey return. \\n\\n\\n\"If the infrastructure isn\\'t there -- and at this rate it won\\'t be -- the \\nrefugees will starve when they go back,\" said one Pakistani refugee official in \\nPeshawar. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the U.N. report, the donations received so far \"constitute no more \\nthan a drop in an ocean of need.\" It said that less than $30 million of the \\npledged donations had been received. \\n\\n\\nDiplomats blamed the U.N. coordinating agency for the shortfall. One, \\nrepresenting a country that pledged tens of millions of dollars last October, \\nsaid he has yet to be contacted by Sadruddin\\'s office for the money. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCritical of U.N. Staff \\n\\n\\nOther diplomats and aid workers said the U.N. staff appointed to handle the aid \\neffort is \"consumed by minutiae,\" \"obsessed by politics\" and \"more interested \\nin the hype than the help.\" \\n\\n\\nThe agency\\'s critics say its mine clearance program is an example of its \\ninefficiency. Estimates of the number of land mines that were strewn across \\nAfghanistan by the Soviets and the guerrillas range from 1 million to 30 \\nmillion. Experts say it will take months to train enough refugees to make the \\nprogram work. \\n\\n\\nA number of refugees who tried to go back to their villages from camps in \\nPakistan, after the villages were liberated by the guerrillas last summer, have \\nreturned to Pakistan missing arms and legs blown off by mines in wheat fields \\nand along village paths. \\n\\n\\nMost refugee officials agree that the mines could be a serious deterrent to \\nrefugees who may want to go home. Tremendous pressure has been brought to bear \\non the United Nations to start training classes in mine recognition and \\ndisposal. But as one diplomat complained, \"the United Nations is doing \\nabsolutely nothing to get this program under way.\" \\n\\n\\nHe added, \"If the rebels won the war tomorrow and told the refugees to go home, \\nmost of them would be back a few weeks later missing their hands and feet.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign Disposal Experts \\n\\n\\nThe U.S. government, which has donated $2 million to the mine disposal program, \\nhas sent 38 U.S. Army detonation experts to Peshawar, and they were joined the \\nother day by mine disposal teams from France and Turkey. \\n\\n\\nBut still the United Nations has failed to start the program, and the experts \\nhave been sitting in Peshawar with little or nothing to do. \\n\\n\\nWestern diplomats have also criticized Prince Sadruddin for failing to obtain \\nmines from the Soviets to use as teaching tools, despite several high-level \\nmeetings with the Soviets. \\n\\n\\nA Western expert said 31 types of Soviet mines are involved and \"we need \\nhundreds of them to teach these refugees how to get rid of them.\" He said U.S. \\nintelligence agencies have only a small number of the mines. \\n\\n\\nThe critics charge that the U.N. coordinator is preoccupied with an ambition to \\nbecome U.N. secretary general, a post that would require the endorsement of the \\nSoviet Union. Sadruddin denies the charge. \\n\\n\\nTalking about the difficulties in coordinating the huge reconstruction program, \\nSadruddin said: \"We face an extraordinarily complex situation. . . . We are \\ntreading new ground.\" \\n\\n\\nHe said his role is made all the more difficult because of the United Nations\\' \\nneutral role and its inability to predict who will be in power in Kabul when \\nthe refugees decide to go home. \\n\\n\\nOne of the most senior Pakistani refugee officials, who had helped to \\ncoordinate the care and feeding of 3.2 million people, has been sharply \\ncritical of the U.N. effort. \\n\\n\\nHe said Sadruddin\\'s agency has not built a single storage facility for the \\n350,000 tons of wheat the United Nations estimates will be needed in \\nAfghanistan if only half the refugees decide to return this year. The U.N. \\nagencies involved in the effort, he said, have \"made a lot of fuss and \\npropaganda but not done any work.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA SHATTERED AFGHANISTAN FINDS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe always knew the Soviets would leave, my Afghan friends and I, but we never \\nthought it would be like this, with bloody anarchy stalking 2 million civilians \\nin the winter-bound capital of Kabul. Somehow our naive idealism envisioned a \\njoyous triumph, a liberation, a clear victory. We joked about being \"on the \\nfirst jeep into the liberated city of Kabul,\" a homecoming to a city I left \\ndays before the Soviet invasion. Noor Jehan, a fiery-tongued, widowed refugee, \\nexpressed the passion of millions when she cried, \"If God wills, we will run \\ntoward Afghanistan, we will run barefoot as fast as we can, as soon as we hear \\nthat our homeland is free.\" \\n\\n\\nIn the darkest years of the war, few foreign analysts believed the Soviets \\nwould ever leave. There were grim predictions of Afghanistan becoming another \\nSoviet republic, or the country being split. The Soviets had never retreated \\nonce they invaded, pundits pointed out, so we might as well accept Afghanistan \\nas lost and control the damage. \\n\\n\\nBut there was a factor that simply would not fit into statistical calculations \\nand political projections: the faith of the Afghan people. They truly believed \\nthey could repulse the Soviets, as the people of Afghanistan had sooner or \\nlater repulsed every invader in their history. Those who knew the Afghans well \\nknew that they really would fight \"till the last breath, till the last drop of \\nblood,\" an oft-quoted phrase. No one ever \"died\" in the war; he or she \"was \\nmartyred,\" and thus reserved a special place in Paradise. Yet Afghan faith was \\nrarely fanatical. Most fighters wanted to live to fight another day, but \\nbravely accepted the possibility of martyrdom. \\n\\n\\nCertainly the advent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and glasnost created a favorable \\nclimate for Soviet withdrawal, as the venture could be blamed on his \\npredecessors. But it was the proud and lonely faith of the Afghan people that \\nenabled them to go on fighting for nine years, like someone hoping to stay \\nalive long enough to find a miracle drug. \\n\\n\\nAs the Soviets left, there were no jeeps rolling triumphantly into the besieged \\ncity of Kabul, no flowers for the moujahedeen freedom fighters, little enough \\ncelebration. Many mourned, for the Soviets had bombed civilians near the \\nstrategic Salang Tunnel just before the pullout began. The moujahedeen, not \\nparty to the Geneva Accords, were still fighting, tightening the noose around \\nan ill-supplied city of frightened, cold, hungry civilians, many their \\nsupporters. \\n\\n\\nNor will there be a mass return of the 5 million refugees in Pakistan and Iran. \\nNoor Jehan will not lead her family back to her broken village, barefoot on the \\ncold stones, for the Soviets have left 10 million to 30 million land mines as a \\nlegacy to the people of Afghanistan. \\n\\n\\nStill, the Soviets really are leaving. Western news coverage in recent months \\nhas been less of heroic Afghan resistance fighters and more of anxious young \\nSoviet boys in Kabul, waiting for their numbers to come up in either the death \\nlottery or the home lottery. The parallels with Vietnam are chilling. \\n\\n\\nA messy war is now turning into a messy civil war. Communists and collaborators \\nscramble for available visas, as Najibullah\\'s government stumbles without its \\nSoviet prop and Afghan soldiers, mostly reluctant conscripts, are caught in the \\nmiddle. While Najibullah continues to insist that the People\\'s Democratic Party \\nis \"a major power\" in Afghanistan, moujahedeen representatives are equally \\ninsistent that there is no place for communists in a postwar government. \\n\\n\\nThe moujahedeen and their supporters are unlikely to be forgiving toward those \\nwhom they hold responsible for the deaths of a million Afghans. Unfortunately, \\nit may be hard to tell who was really a collaborator and who a \"good Muslim.\" \\nMany high party officials will have the cash and connections to get out, while \\nordinary party members and young conscripts will be left to face a violent and \\nunforgiving populace. \\n\\n\\nA period of anarchy may follow the fall of Najibullah\\'s government, as there is \\nno nationally accepted leader. The Pakistan-based moujahedeen leadership \\nremains fractured, despite plans to elect a transitional government. A few \\nbattle-proved commanders are much admired, but none universally. Many educated \\nAfghans, particularly women, fear that the extreme fundamentalist faction, \\nsupported by the United States all these years, could establish a government \\nbased on an intolerant brand of Islam. Without U.S. guns and money, however, \\nthey are not likely to maintain the loyalty of the majority of non-fanatical \\nAfghans for long. Factions may battle one another, as they have with varying \\ndegrees of hostility over the past nine years. The one hope is that, as the \\nlate poet Ustad Khalilullah Khalili said to me a few years ago, \"People will \\nsoon tire of civil war. They have seen enough fighting and death.\" \\n\\n\\nAnother uncertainty is the fate of 20,000 children who were taken forcibly from \\ntheir parents for \"education\" in the Soviet Union. Will they be returned to \\ntheir families, or are they the seeds of future communist cadres? And what of \\nseveral hundred Soviet prisoners ofwar? Will the moujahedeen release them, and \\nif so, will these soldiers dare return home? \\n\\n\\nStrangely, in all these years of covering the war and the refugees, no one I \\nknew well had been killed. On my last visit to Pakistan, in December, I \\napprehensively asked about the moujahedeen who had escorted me on my two trips \\ninto the war zone, patient with my plodding pace, understanding of my fears. I \\nsighed with relief when told they were all fine and still fighting. Then one \\nnight someone came and said, \"I have bad news about Azim. He was martyred a few \\nmonths ago.\" \\n\\n\\nAzim Zarbakhsh, our wonderful flute-playing friend, our ecstatic Sufi with the \\nlong hair and the Rasputin beard. He would spout Pashtu and Farsi poetry on the \\nspot, then launch into Afghan folk songs on his homemade wooden flute. He \\nplayed in the houses of the wealthy and the rooms of the poor, preferring \\nkebabs and tea to the fancy buffet dinners where he was embarrassed because he \\ndidn\\'t know how to use a knife and fork. He was a wandering minstrel, a free \\nspirit, a freedom fighter who died in the last months of the war. \\n\\n\\nFor the Afghans, this has been a righteous war, one they had no choice but to \\nfight. Afghanistan has not known such destruction since the time of Genghis \\nKhan. Observers estimate that 50% of the villages are in ruins and that roads, \\nwells and irrigation systems are destroyed or fallen into disrepair.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA REMARKABLE REALISM ON AFGHANISTAN; \\n\\n\\nGORBACHEV SAW THE FUTILITY, WE SHOULD SEE THE OPPORTUNITY \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe withdrawal of the last Soviet soldier from Afghanistan is an occasion not \\nonly for rejoicing but for reflection as well. The effect of Soviet defeat may \\nprove more profound than the consequences of American failure in Vietnam. \\nMikhail S. Gorbachev\\'s remarkable realism here demonstrates an unprecedented \\nwillingness to cooperate in resolving regional conflicts. More recent \\ninitiatives in Angola and Cambodia suggest that this willingness extends to \\nother conflicts, too. Even in Central America, the graveyard of the \\nReagan-Shultz-Abrams campaign to overthrow the Sandinistas, a satisfactory \\nsettlement appears within reach -- if the United States has the will to \\nstretch. Current circumstances present the Bush Administration with the widest \\nwindow of opportunity in the postwar period to decisively conclude the era of \\nSoviet \"wars of liberation.\" \\n\\n\\nIn 1979, when the Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan, no one could have dreamed \\nof such an outcome. To appreciate the magnitude of this victory and its \\nimplications, it is necessary to go back nine years to American and Soviet \\nperceptions of the stakes. \\n\\n\\nFor President Jimmy Carter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was a formative \\nexperience. As he confessed: \"This action of the Soviets has made a more \\ndramatic change in my opinion of what the Soviets\\' ultimate goals are than \\nanything they\\'ve done in the previous time that I\\'ve been in office.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Carter Administration interpreted the Soviet action as a geostrategic grab. \\nAfghanistan translated the Soviet military buildup into action. For the first \\ntime since World War II, Soviet military forces were directly engaged outside \\nEurope. Afghanistan represented a calculated step in Russia\\'s centuries-old \\nquest for warm-water ports. Domination of the world\\'s strategic oil reserves in \\nthe Persian Gulf was the unspoken prize. \\n\\n\\nAll this became conventional wisdom after 1980 and shaped the Reagan \\nAdministration\\'s views of Soviet ambitions. Indeed, it continues to dominate \\nthe thinking of many Americans today. \\n\\n\\nStatements by the Soviet government and commentaries by Soviet advisers did \\nlittle to allay the American concerns. In conversations with Westerners, even \\nSoviets who had opposed Soviet intervention made a point of emphasizing the \\ndifference between Afghanistan and Vietnam. As one told me bluntly: \"Whatever \\nthe merits of the decision, having decided to act, the Soviet Union will do \\nwhatever is necessary to win. We will never bug out for lack of guts or heart.\" \\n\\n\\nYet Gorbachev has accepted defeat, with only a fig leaf of calling it \\nstalemate. He has not even demanded the \"decent interval\" that Henry A. \\nKissinger sought in 1975. \\n\\n\\nAmericans who believed, as I did, that Afghanistan constituted a geostrategic \\nchallenge must now ask how Gorbachev\\'s reversal of that policy can be \\nexplained. In the light of the potential benefits of success, and the probable \\nconsequences of failure, what kind of Soviet leader and what kind of Soviet \\nUnion could actually do such a thing? \\n\\n\\nA chorus of commentary explains simply that the Soviets found the costs \\nexceeding the benefits. But this tautology just rephrases the puzzle. Clearly \\nthe combination of Afghan courage, Western supplies (including American Stinger \\nmissiles), international condemnation and domestic discontent imposed heavy \\ncosts. But who says that these costs exceed the benefits of realizing a \\nvenerable geopolitical aspiration? Had the Soviet Union continued the war and \\neven annexed Afghanistan or parts thereof, these pundits would solemnly \\nannounce that the benefits exceeded the costs. \\n\\n\\nConsider the consequences of Soviet acceptance of defeat and withdrawal. How \\nwill the Soviet army explain to itself and its supporters that a military \\nestablishment that consumes 15%-20% of the Soviet gross national product, that \\nfaced no restrictions on its pursuit of the war, in a system of government that \\nputs long-term interests ahead of short-term pressures of public opinion, \\nnonetheless lost. Even more significant will be the reverberations in Soviet \\nsatellite and client states, since the defeat in Afghanistan rolls back for the \\nfirst time the Brezhnev doctrine of the irreversibility of communist gains. \\n\\n\\nWhat will happen in Afghanistan? The Soviet client government is unlikely to \\nlast as long as Nguyen Van Thieu did in Vietnam. The prospects of continuing \\nwarfare and instability, perhaps even a \"Lebanon\" right on the Soviet border, \\ncannot be excluded. \\n\\n\\nThe crucial factor explaining the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan is \\nGorbachev. Reviewing the facts -- a declining Soviet economy, increasingly \\nburdensome Third World clients and an international system evolving away from \\nmilitary-based bipolarity toward technologically determined multipolarity -- \\nGorbachev has come to a radically different conception of how the Soviet \\nUnion\\'s interests can best be secured. While his predecessors sought greater \\nsecurity through support for Marxist-Leninist revolutions, Gorbachev has seen \\nthat real security can best be achieved, for the foreseeable future, through a \\nnormalization of relations that respects both sovereignty and international \\nlaw. If the Bush Administration will think clearly about what U.S. interests \\nrequire, it can now settle this aspect of the Cold War on terms that achieve \\nour original objectives. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

A resolution is going to have to be one without a PDPA presence.\" \\n\\n\\nState Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that during the talks, the U.S. \\ndelegation also expects to talk with the Soviet Union about developments in \\nIran. The U.S. delegation will be headed by John Kelly, the assistant secretary \\nof state for Near East and South Asian affairs. \\n\\n\\nIn the wake of the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last month, Hashemi \\nRafsanjani, the powerful leader of the Iranian Parliament, visited Moscow and \\nconcluded a series of agreements upgrading economic cooperation between the two \\ncountries. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReady to Discuss Iran \\n\\n\\n\"The Soviets have indicated to us that they\\'d be prepared to answer questions \\nabout Iran,\" one U.S. official said. \\n\\n\\nAfter the Soviet Union finished pulling its troops out of Afghanistan on Feb. \\n15, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a personal message to President \\nBush, urging the United States to help in bringing about a peaceful settlement \\nof the conflict between the government in Kabul and the anti-Communist Afghan \\nrebels. \\n\\n\\nSoviet officials also urged that the United States stop supplying arms to the \\nrebels. But Bush turned down the Soviet overtures, saying that -- because the \\nAfghan government possessed a huge stockpile of arms left behind by the Soviet \\ntroops -- it would \"not be fair\" for the United States to cut off supplies to \\nthe Afghan resistance. \\n\\n\\nAt that time, many U.S. officials suggested that the Afghan resistance groups \\nwere in a strong position to win a military victory over the Kabul government. \\nBut over the last five months, the rebels have failed in repeated efforts to \\ncapture the strategic eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, which lies along the \\nmain road from Kabul to the border with Pakistan. \\n\\n\\nSome U.S. officials have said that the unexpectedly weak performance by the \\nAfghan resistance groups on the battlefield is at least partly the result of a \\nhuge increase in arms shipments from the Soviet Union to the Afghan government. \\n\\n\\nBut a second factor has been the divisions among the resistance groups.

Yesterday that case was adjourned until later in\\nthe month for Greenpeace to assemble more laboratory evidence. The group\\nregards the ICI action as a test case on water regulation and says that if\\nit is successful more prosecutions of chemical companies may follow.\\nThe two highly-publicised cases mark a new policy by one of Britain's\\nlargest environmental pressure groups to bring legal actions itself, rather\\nthan wait for government regulatory authorities to do so. Those watching\\nthis drama of David and Goliath may wonder, however, how Greenpeace is\\nfinancing the its campaigning strategy.\\nIts financial muscle has startled some court observers. On Wednesday it told\\nthe court that it would compensate British Nuclear Fuels - possibly several\\nhundred thousand pounds, on BNF's estimates - if the tests were delayed\\nuntil today. The offer was turned down, but it raised questions about the\\ngroup's finances.\\nThe answer, according to Lord Peter Melchett, executive director of\\nGreenpeace UK, is that annual revenue from subscriptions, contributions and\\nmerchandise accommodates the cost of lawyers and research. Although revenue\\nhas suffered from the recession, Greenpeace UK's income in 1992 was Pounds\\n4.1m net of fund-raising expenses, compared with Pounds 3.8m in 1991.\\nGreenpeace says that legal costs have been small so far , partly because it\\nuses an in-house lawyer. Lord Melchett acknowledges however, that 'it's\\nexpensive if you lose'. So far Greenpeace has not lost big cases. But it is\\ndefending a libel action by Rechem, the waste treatment company.\\nThe companies on its target list must wonder whether a court setback could\\nhamper its ability to bring more prosecutions.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nSeptember 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18 AND GROWING -- GREENPEACE COMES OF AGE AS ECOLOGICAL CONCERNS RISE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen 12 nature lovers painted \"Greenpeace\" on a rickety boat in 1971 and set \\nsail to halt U.S. underground nuclear arms tests on a Pacific Ocean island, it \\nwas considered eccentric. \\n\\n\\nEighteen years and scores of dramatic stunts later, Greenpeace is a robust \\norganization at the forefront of environmental protection with a $75-million \\nannual budget, 3 million members and offices in 21 nations. \\n\\n\\n\"Respectability worries me,\" said Steve Sawyer, executive director of \\nGreenpeace International. \"We have to be sure not to lose our cutting edge.\" \\n\\n\\nGreenpeace moved its headquarters from London to Amsterdam this summer. The \\nchange, prompted by lower office rents, comes at a time when the organization \\nis changing directions. \\n\\n\\nWith politicians rushing to show their environmental credentials, Greenpeace\\'s \\nrole is shifting from maverick to responsible monitor in the fight to conserve \\nnature. \\n\\n\\n\"Ten years ago, no one knew what PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were. Now all \\nyou have to do is say: \\'There\\'s this ship with nasty things aboard it,\\' and \\npeople don\\'t want it in their port. We don\\'t have to blockade it,\" he said. \\n\\n\\n\"The dramatic actions we were once known for aren\\'t always necessary these days \\nto bring things to people\\'s attention. Sometimes we can just point a finger and \\nit\\'s enough,\" Sawyer said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkillful Use of Media \\n\\n\\nThe greater public awareness of pollution and environmental hazards is in part \\na tribute to the efforts of Greenpeace, which has skillfully used the media to \\nadvertise its cause. \\n\\n\\nAn increasingly large part of Greenpeace\\'s budget goes to lobbying governments, \\nthe European Community and international organizations to take measures to \\nprotect the environment -- and the organization now finds its ideas gain wide \\nacceptance. \\n\\n\\nIt has been a hard-won battle. Over the years, Greenpeace activists, often \\naccompanied by camera crews or reporters, have risked arrest and even death. \\n\\n\\nThey have weaved rubber dinghies alongside whaling vessels to stop the harpoons \\nof hunters, scaled industrial chimneys to draw attention to polluters, chained \\nthemselves to nuclear waste dumping chutes and sprayed baby seals with green \\ndye to prevent them from being killed for their white fur. \\n\\n\\nFor years they have been a thorn to industrial polluters and governments \\ntesting nuclear weapons. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShip Bombed and Sunk \\n\\n\\nJust how much of a thorn became clear in July, 1985, when the Greenpeace vessel \\nRainbow Warrior was blown up by French secret agents in New Zealand for \\nprotesting against French nuclear testing. A photographer on board drowned when \\nthe boat sank. \\n\\n\\nThe attack only helped boost Greenpeace\\'s fame. \\n\\n\\nBut the organization has not grown complacent. \"There are still a lot of things \\nthat need to be brought to people\\'s attention,\" Sawyer said. \\n\\n\\nGreenpeace still carries out its dramatic operations -- a revamped Rainbow \\nWarrior is to sail to the Pacific soon. \\n\\n\\nBut it is also trying to expand operations. It has begun making inroads in the \\nThird World, setting up an office in Argentina in 1987 and Costa Rica in 1988. \\nIt hopes to create a branch in Brazil, and it would like to open a Moscow \\noffice. \\n\\n\\nAbout 40% of its funding still goes to projects involving its seven vessels. \\nBut 15% goes to lobbying and information campaigns and 10% to research, usually \\nfarmed out to consultants. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Key Issues \\n\\n\\nMost recently, the organization has decided to concentrate its efforts on \\npreservation of the Antarctic and to pressing for nuclear free seas. \\n\\n\\nIn August, it unsuccessfully tried to block testing of the U.S. Trident \\nsubmarine. \\n\\n\\n\"We decided to start a campaign on this issue in 1987 because it was a part of \\nthe arms race which was out of the public eye. It was not under international \\ncontrol, and the scope for accidents is great,\" Sawyer explained. \\n\\n\\n\"People have to realize that the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) Treaty \\ndoesn\\'t mean much if the missiles pulled out of Germany, the Netherlands and \\nthe United Kingdom go on submarines,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nOn the Antarctic, Greenpeace saw a chance to be a major actor in preserving \\nhumankind\\'s last wilderness. \\n\\n\\n\"The Antarctic needs to be saved from exploitation of its mineral reserves. We \\nhad a sense that perhaps we could get in and save it before it got screwed up \\nby humans,\" Sawyer said. \\n\\n\\nThe Antarctic has a major impact on the world\\'s weather and, its preservation \\nis also important for base-line environmental impact studies, he explained. \\n\\n\\nGreenpeace has set up a base camp in the Antarctic -- the only non-governmental \\ngroup to do so -- to monitor the area. \\n\\n\\nIt also plans to intensify its fight against pollution of the atmosphere. \\n\\n\\nIt continues in its more traditional fields -- fighting for the preservation of \\nsea animals and alerting the public to toxic chemicals and nuclear waste. \\n\\n\\nSawyer is convinced that in the long run, Greenpeace\\'s message that people must \\nchange their ways to preserve the Earth will get across. \\n\\n\\n\"The environment has to rise to the No. 1 issue on the world agenda. It\\'s \\ngetting there,\" he said. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

But on the\\nmorning of July 10 1985, Pete Wilkinson and other board members of\\nGreenpeace International, planning an anti-whaling campaign from a hotel\\nroom in Bournemouth, Dorset, received a reverse-charge call from New Zealand\\ntelling them that their flagship, the Rainbow Warrior, had been sunk by two\\nexplosions. One crew member died.\\nIt emerged that the blasts were caused by explosives deliberately attached\\nto the hull, and that French secret agents were responsible. The\\ninternational condemnation that followed brought Greenpeace, already one of\\nthe world's best-known environmental pressure groups, greater prominence.\\nFor Wilkinson, a leading campaigner for Greenpeace in the UK since its early\\ndays in the 1970s, the evidence of the violence which their protests could\\nprovoke was a turning point, which 'forced me to make the transition from\\nthe idealism of the '70s into the harsh reality of the '80s'.\\nBut Wilkinson also makes clear that the sinking coincided with - and may\\nhave accelerated - a change in Greenpeace's character. From a small band of\\npenniless conservationists in the 1970s, it now spans 30 countries with an\\nannual worldwide income from donations of Dollars 150m.\\nIn this entertaining chronicle, Wilkinson makes the charge that, during this\\ntransformation, Greenpeace has 'lost direction'. It has become bureaucratic,\\nhe claims, staffed with lawyers and well-paid administrators with\\nbriefcases, who are unwilling to don rubber suits to stop up the outlet\\npipes of industrial plants.\\nThis metamorphosis is characteristic of many 'green' pressure groups, he\\nalleges. In his view, 'the green movement has faced a difficult time since\\n(the mid-1980s). Some would say it has been neutered. It is certainly less\\nradical'.\\nHe bases his case on a comparison of present sophistication with the\\nenthusiasm of campaigns in the early 1970s, even though methods then were\\nsometimes amateurish. In one campaign for Friends of the Earth, he and his\\ncolleagues set out to collect non-returnable soft drinks bottles from\\nstreets to deliver to Schweppes, the manufacturer, in protest at the litter.\\nFailing to find enough, they were forced to buy hundreds of bottles and\\npoured the fizzy drink into vats. (Friends of the Earth says this manoeuvre\\nwould be unthinkable now.)\\nDespite the group's rapid growth, the hippy element remained strong for\\nyears. Wilkinson describes campaigners dancing naked under the Antarctic\\nsun.\\nBut the group's interest in attracting media attention developed rapidly. A\\n1985 BBC documentary 'netted Greenpeace a cool Pounds 100,000 in boosted\\ndonations and membership', he says. When an assault on the Department of the\\nEnvironment's tower block failed to attract immediate publicity, Wilkinson\\nurged a colleague to call the police. His anxiety subsided only when 'a\\nsquad car came screaming up and I heard the familiar words: 'Wilkinson,\\nyou're nicked' '.\\nDespite those self-conscious heroics, Wilkinson is an engagingly\\nself-deprecating narrator. He notes he 'never quite seemed to be given\\nresponsibility': he is not, he makes clear, one of the natural stars of the\\ngreen movement.\\nBut beyond the details of Greenpeace's evolution, his account illustrates\\nhow the green movement built up public support and how the nature of\\ncampaigning has changed.\\n'When Greenpeace had grown to be a sought-after prize, control of the\\norganisation was to preoccupy the time of many people,' he says. From 1981\\nGreenpeace began to build a formal structure, linking all the national\\nbranches, which Wilkinson found claustrophobic. It led, he says, to\\n'computer and communications technology as could be found in the offices of\\nRio Tinto Zinc or ICI'.\\nWilkinson himself, with the sound of Jimi Hendrix blaring in the background,\\nfinally drafted his resignation letter in 1987. Since then, there is\\nevidence that green groups have tried to address some of the flaws he\\nidentifies. In 1990 Greenpeace began to trim some of its internal hierarchy.\\nChris Rose, campaigns director of Greenpeace UK, says: 'We are trying to put\\nmore of our resources into the front line - though I know that sounds like\\nthe reform of the National Health Service.'\\nBut he contests many of Wilkinson's charges. According to Rose, 'we are as\\nkeen to engage in direct actions as ever, but effectiveness is now the main\\nquestion'. He points out that when Greenpeace blocked British Nuclear Fuels'\\ndischarge pipe off the Cumbrian coast in 1987, 'two people went to jail and\\nthe plant carried on'. Instead, last year, in trying to stop BNF's Thorp\\nreprocessing plant, Greenpeace took BNF and the government to court.\\nAlthough in the end Greenpeace lost, it delayed the start of operations for\\na year.\\nRose also points out that targets have become more difficult to find: some\\nof the worst cases of pollution - such as sewage, or dumping highly coloured\\ntitanium oxide waste - have been addressed. The group now needs lawyers and\\nresearchers because, frequently, the cause of pollution 'is not clear cut',\\nhe says.\\nGreenpeace will now also talk to big business: it recently helped\\nmanufacturers develop a fridge that does not harm the ozone layer.\\nRose, one of the green movement's more thoughtful strategists, is surely\\nright that the pressure groups needed to change in these ways. While\\nWilkinson can be accused of nostalgia on many counts, he raises an important\\nquestion: whether Greenpeace's supporters are reconciled to this change. If\\nthey are not, and if their donations are still inspired by the images of\\nheroic campaigns, then Greenpeace's income and influence may eventually be\\nthreatened by its growing sophistication.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

JOHNSTON; \\n\\n\\nUNEARTHING ECO-CRIMINALS; \\n\\n\\nD.A. SPECIAL UNIT AIMS TO CLEAN UP ON COUNTY POLLUTERS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the public discovers environmental protection, prosecutors are discovering \\nenvironmental crime. From the Justice Department in Washington to city \\nattorney's offices around the country, environmental protection has suddenly \\nbecome a front-burner issue, and new resources are being devoted to the complex \\ntask of enforcing pollution laws. \\n\\n\\n Environmental crimes can range from clandestine dumping of toxic waste to \\nunauthorized emissions of chemicals to violations of obscure monitoring or \\nrecord-keeping rules. In the past, most such transgressions drew only small \\nfines or warnings, and criminal prosecutions were rare. \\n\\n\\n But today, empowered by new legislation beefing up the penalties for many \\nenvironmental crimes, prosecutors are seeking felony convictions carrying heavy \\nfines and jail sentences for polluters. Illegal dumping accounts for the most \\nserious cases, but less damaging violations of previously unenforced laws -- \\nsuch as those requiring the monitoring of underground fuel tanks -- are also \\ndrawing attention. \\n\\n\\n The complexity of many environmental regulations, however, can make \\nenvironmental prosecution a difficult business. Prosecutors must undertake \\nlengthy investigations to determine the source of pollution, for example, and \\nthen make tricky judgments about who is ultimately responsible for it and how \\nheavily they should be punished. \\n\\n\\n In the Orange County district attorney's office, the environmental crime unit \\nhas more than doubled in size over the past year, and now includes two \\nfull-time and one part-time deputy district attorneys, two investigators and a \\nparalegal. Times staff writer Jonathan Weber recently spoke with unit \\nsupervisor Jan J. Nolan and deputies Christopher P. Kralick and Gerald G. \\nJohnston about their priorities as environmental prosecutors and about how they \\nhandle some of the more difficult aspects of this new area of law. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ. What are some of the more serious environmental crime cases that have been \\nprosecuted over the past several years? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: First of all, you have to understand that this unit is fairly new. It \\nstarted about four years ago, but in the past year we have had a significant \\nchange in personnel, and we have enlarged the unit. So we can go back about a \\nyear. \\n\\n\\nOne of our major current cases is against the Metropolitan Water District. \\nTheir plumbing system (allegedly) discharged some toxic chemicals into a creek \\nin Santa Ana Canyon, and several bicyclists who rode through the creek suffered \\nburns on their legs. So we have felony charges pending against the MWD, and we \\nhave misdemeanors against some of the officers and directors of the \\ncorporation. \\n\\n\\nQ. What other major cases are pending? \\n\\n\\nA. Johnston: We are reviewing allegations against W.C. Richards Co. (operator \\nof an Anaheim paint manufacturing plant). In that case, we were anonymously \\ninformed that the company was unlawfully disposing of its hazardous wastes, \\nsolvents and other things that were byproducts of the paint manfacturing \\nprocess. Ordinarily, you have to manifest (register) these products and dispose \\nof them at a proper facility. It's very expensive, about $500 a barrel. \\n\\n\\nWhat allegedly was happening at W.C. Richards was that employees each day were \\ntaking those waste products and mixing them with sawdust. They would then take \\nthat mixture and shovel it into a dumpster, which was put out for disposal at \\nan ordinary landfill. As far as we know, all those substances went to the \\nBrea-Olinda landfill, and under state law that is not a proper disposition of \\nthose kinds of waste. \\n\\n\\nQ. You said that you got an anonymous tip. How do you generally find your leads \\nin these kinds of cases? \\n\\n\\nA. Johnston: In cases where you have unlawful dumping, you often have employees \\nwho are aware of it and become disgruntled, or become worried about their \\nsafety or the safety of others, and they will call some regulatory agency. \\nWhatever agency hears about it will then usually come to our environmental \\ncrime task force, which meets once a month to discuss cases that have come up. \\nFrom there, we will frequently initiate investigations. \\n\\n\\nQ. Who is on the task force? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: It's chaired by our office, and it includes the California Highway \\nPatrol, the Department of Fish and Game, the Health Services Department, the \\nRegional Water Quality Control Board, the Orange County Sanitation District, \\nthe Orange County Environmental Management Agency, and the County Fire \\nDepartment and local fire departments. The Air Quality Management District is \\npart of it, and we hope to get them to start attending. \\n\\n\\nQ. When was this task force put together? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: About three years ago. \\n\\n\\nQ. You said the task force meets once a month. How many cases are discussed at \\neach meeting? \\n\\n\\nA. Kralick: About 15 or 20. \\n\\n\\nJohnston: And a lot of these things carry over from month to month. Many of \\nthese investigations are lengthy and complex, and it might take four or five or \\nsix months to put one of these cases together. We put together the \\ninvestigations, and the agencies with the proper authority and interest will \\ncoordinate in different cases. \\n\\n\\nQ. How many cases do you expect to prosecute this year? \\n\\n\\nA. Johnston: Probably around 100. But we have a lot of cases coming in. \\nEnvironmental awareness is expanding so much that many more agencies are now \\nbecoming interested and coming to us with the cases. \\n\\n\\nQ. What are the largest categories of violations? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: About half will have to do with underground storage tanks. We've made \\na big effort in enforcing those rules. (Owners of underground storage tanks \\nused for fuel and waste are required to monitor them for leaks and remove them \\nif leaks are found.) \\n\\n\\nQ. What are the other large categories of environmental crime? \\n\\n\\nA. Kralick: Illegal disposal of hazardous waste. \\n\\n\\nJohnston: Business emergency plans is another area where we have a lot of \\nmaterial coming in. \\n\\n\\nQ. That's the requirement that businesses using hazardous materials have \\nstorage and emergency evacuation plans? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: Yes. In most of those cases we're concentrating on compliance with \\nthe law rather than prosecution. \\n\\n\\nJohnston: We also have quite a few smaller cases, involving dumping of \\nmaterials into the bays and harbors. There is a real problem with that in \\nOrange County, especially in Newport Harbor, and in Dana Point. The people in \\nthe boats are not always following the rules in regard to what they do with the \\nwaste from the toilets. \\n\\n\\nThe materials they dump tend to concentrate in the bays, and then you get \\nproduction of coliform (fecal) bacteria and the water becomes unhealthy. So \\nwe're trying to do what we can to prosecute those cases when we can find them. \\nWe're getting the word out: You have to take more care in dumping waste from \\nboats. \\n\\n\\nQ. In cases where you have a choice, how do you decide whether to go for felony \\ncharges or misdemeanor charges? \\n\\n\\nA. Johnston: It's a little hard to enumerate exactly, but I think it just \\ndepends on how serious we feel the conduct is, the degree of knowledge that the \\nperson had about the damage they were doing, the actual damage -- if we can \\nfigure it out -- and the volume and type of hazardous material. Generally, \\nwe're looking for someone who has dumped a significant quantity of hazardous \\nmaterial for us to file a felony. \\n\\n\\nQ. How about the issue of knowing or not knowing? The law has been interpreted \\nto say that you can bring felony charges even when someone didn't realize that \\nwhat they were doing was illegal. Supposing someone has dumped a significant \\namount of waste, but the person really thought that the disposal method was \\nproper when it wasn't. You could file felony charges, but some people might \\nthink that's not fair. \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: It depends on the amount of damage they have done, and the quantity \\nof waste. In a situation like that, where they really didn't know, and there is \\na problem with whether or not they should have known, we also have the civil \\nremedy. But based on that one element, we couldn't say whether we would file a \\nfelony. \\n\\n\\nWe would have to look at all the facts. It's a very serious situation for a \\ncorporation to have felony charges filed against them, so we don't take that \\nlightly. On the other hand, neither do we take lightly what they do to our \\nenvironment and community. \\n\\n\\nQ. How do you decide between civil and criminal charges? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: That's another very difficult evaluation. It's going to depend on \\nculpability, on how egregious the conduct was, on the knowledge factor, on \\nwhether or not the officers and directors of the corporation were involved. \\n\\n\\nJohnston: It's a difficult thing to quantify. You have to evaluate all the \\ncircumstances and do what you think is correct. \\n\\n\\nQ. That seems like a pretty soft definition. There is a big difference between \\ncriminal and civil charges, and I would think there would be a more defined \\nstandard as to what is a criminal violation and what is not. \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: We look at every case from the aspect of filing criminally. That's \\nwhat a prosecutors office does. We file criminally. If there is a lot of \\nmitigating circumstance, such as a lack of knowledge, we may determine that \\nit's better for the community and the corporation to handle the case civilly. \\nSometimes it may hurt the corporation more to go civil. But primarily we go \\ncriminal unless there is sufficient mitigation to go civil. \\n\\n\\nQ. What are some of the special difficulties involved in environmental \\nprosecutions? You said these are often very complex and difficult cases. What \\nmakes them complicated? \\n\\n\\nA. Kralick: The first problem is detection. When you have someone doing illegal \\ndisposal, it's the whole nature of illegal disposal to avoid detection in any \\nway, shape or form. Then, even if you are detected, there is the question of \\nwho will be held ultimately responsible for that act. \\n\\n\\nIf you have an individual working for a company and operating a truck, and he \\njust flushes the tanker (of hazardous material) in some vacant field, the \\nquestion is whether he was acting under the authority and direction of some \\ncorporate officer, or just acting on his own to save time because he's running \\nbehind on his schedule. \\n\\n\\nThen we have what you would have with any criminal case: lab reports, \\ncollection of the samples, preservation of the samples, analysis, getting the \\nwitnesses into court, and whatever is associated with any case. \\n\\n\\nJohnston: In addition, there are complexities you wouldn't normally have. For \\none, the statutory framework is different. There is a large body of statutes \\nand regulations that you wouldn't normally see. There are a lot of regulatory \\nagencies that would potentially have jurisdiction, and that will require \\ncoordination to figure out who should be doing what. \\n\\n\\nThat's one reason we have the task force, to make sure all the proper \\nauthorities are in there and participating. To give an example: If we had a \\nspill of solvents into the ground in a waterway, we might have the \\nEnvironmental Management Agency, because it's a manmade waterway; the AQMD, \\nbecause the solvents are evaporating into the atmosphere; the Health Care \\nAgency, because it involves soil contamination; and the Regional Water Quality \\nBoard, because there is the potential that it could migrate into ground water. \\nSo there is a lot you have to think about any time these spills happen. \\n\\n\\nQ. How much time do you spend on coordination? \\n\\n\\nA. Kralick: We have an investigator, Kip Kinnings, who coordinates most of that \\nfor us. We're very lucky. He's very experienced, and has been doing this for a \\nnumber of years, and he has developed very good communication with all the \\ndifferent agencies, which helps us tremendously. \\n\\n\\nQ. Do you do any kind of special training to handle these cases? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: When we enlarged the section, the deputies got together and decided \\nit would be a good idea to go to classes at UC Irvine having to do with the \\nregulatory framework, investigations and a series of other things. Also, the \\nCalifornia District Attorneys Assn. puts on seminars, and recently they had a \\nthree-day seminar here in Garden Grove on environmental issues. In June, there \\nwill be an advanced seminar on environmental crime. It's a continual training \\nprocess that we either do on our own or through the D.A.s' association. We're \\nconstantly learning. \\n\\n\\nQ. Clearly, environmental crime is a rapidly growing field. Los Angeles Dist. \\nAtty. Ira Reiner has made it a major priority in his office. How big a priority \\nis it in this office? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: In the last year, we have made it a bigger priority. Our district \\nattorney, Mike Capizzi, has taken a great interest in this unit, allowed us to \\nexpand it with the deputies we have, and I've been told that if we need \\nadditional deputies to handle the workload, we certainly will get them. It's \\ngetting a lot of attention. \\n\\n\\nQ. Do you think you will need more deputies? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: Absolutely. \\n\\n\\nQ. Do you have an ideal size in mind? \\n\\n\\nA. Nolan: You never know where it's going. As environmental crime gets more \\nattention, as more people call in with information, as we get more information \\nfrom other agencies, we could grow up to 25 or 30 deputies. Let's hope it \\ndoesn't get that big, because a lot of our work here is prevention. As we get \\nthe word out about what we're doing and how we're working, we're hoping \\ncorporations will comply with the rules and we won't be in a position to have \\nto expand the unit. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Bronwen Maddox examines their future\\n\\n\\nGreenpeace, the world's most famous environmental group, defender of nature\\nagainst man, now faces threats to its own survival. It has been widely\\napplauded by the public as the conscience of the west, and feared by\\npoliticians and heads of industry. But now, both friends and enemies are\\nasking whether Greenpeace has had its day.\\nAs Pete Wilkinson, a former board member, says: 'Greenpeace now has a fleet\\nof ships running around the oceans looking for something to do.'\\nMany whaling vessels, harried so successfully in the 1970s and 1980s by\\nGreenpeace, have been chased back into port. The cargo ships which once\\ntipped toxic wastes into the seas have been laid up by government orders. On\\nland, the worst effects of industrial effluent have been curbed by new laws.\\nDuring the last quarter of a century, Greenpeace achieved extraordinary\\nsuccess in changing the relationship between advanced industrial societies\\nand the natural world. To some extent, it has campaigned itself out of a\\njob. Moreover, recession in industrialised countries temporarily restrained\\npollution, and also reduced the money available to tackle it.\\nThese tensions have resulted this summer in bitter infighting among\\nGreenpeace's senior members. The row reflects fears that the organisation is\\nlosing its voice: that it can no longer catch the public's imagination as it\\nused to do, or promote visions of a brighter, greener future.\\nThe campaigns which won Greenpeace early prominence - against nuclear\\ntesting, seal culling, and whaling - established a powerful public image of\\ncourageous campaigners in inflatable dinghies risking their lives to\\nchallenge steel ships loaded with weaponry.\\nBut the power of that image is waning. As Wilkinson puts it, the spectacular\\nprotests which became the group's trademark have been becoming 'a bit of a\\nyawn: bigger and bigger banners on bigger and bigger buildings'.\\nTo move forwards now, Greenpeace - and the rest of the environmental\\nmovement - must grapple with difficult economic and scientific issues which\\nmany Greens have so far ignored. However its new quest for solutions to\\nenvironmental problems is taking the group away from the traditional ground\\nof pressure groups and deep into the realm of politics, economics and\\nscience where it has less expertise. As Greenpeace elaborates its theories\\nof how societies should be organised to meet its environmental standards\\nthey are revealed as incoherent.\\nIts present conflicts partly reflect the distance Greenpeace has travelled\\nsince it was founded. Its roots - and its evocative name - grew out of\\nCanadian opposition to US nuclear weapons testing at Amchitka, a tiny island\\noff the western coast of Alaska, in the late 1960s. Two of its founders were\\nQuakers; according to the authorised history of the group, its tactic of\\nspectacular non-violent protests, or 'direct action', was drawn from that\\nreligion's tradition of 'bearing witness', a form of passive resistance.\\nTom Burke, a former director of pressure group Friends of the Earth and\\nadviser to John Gummer, UK environment secretary, says: 'The secret of\\nGreenpeace's success is that it has always looked like David against\\nGoliath.'\\nBut David is now Goliath-sized. Greenpeace operates in 30 countries,\\nconnected by electronic mail and fax, and has five ocean-going ships. Its\\nannual income is about Dollars 150m from its 3.8m members worldwide, even\\nthough individual subscriptions are low. In the UK, a supporter pays Pounds\\n14.50 a year.\\nThe Greenpeace message has proved particularly resonant in north Europe and\\nnorth America: those countries have a deep tradition of romanticism about\\nthe natural world, which also found expression in the 'flower power' of the\\n1960s.\\nGreenpeace cleverly turned that sympathy into active support. David\\nMcTaggart, an American property developer, who was the group's charismatic\\nleader during its formative years, and is now its honorary chairman, wrote\\nto senior staff two years ago: 'We must have at least one soft issue . . .\\nto take the edge off our 'whack-em' image . . . Anybody who has ever tried\\nto sell Greenpeace to the public knows that dreams are better than\\nnightmares at winning people over.'\\nMcTaggart, who now lives on an olive farm near Rome, also explained the way\\nGreenpeace should convert its recruits to what it calls heavy issues:\\n'Hundreds of thousands of people . . . joined Greenpeace to save the whales.\\nWho knows how many heard the message about nukes?'\\nGreenpeace displays similar worldliness in courting the world's media.\\nNewsdesks are well-used to the arrival late on Friday of a thick Greenpeace\\nreport embargoed for Monday papers, which are often short of news. The\\ntactic infuriates government press officers, who are forced to track down\\ncivil servants on the golf courses to extract a reply, but it often\\nsucceeds.\\nAs a result, ministers and industrialists credit the group with great\\ninfluence. Tim Yeo, the former UK environment minister, says: 'We were very\\ncareful to respond to what they were saying about the ozone layer partly\\nbecause we thought they were on the right track but also because public\\ninvolvement was important.'\\nAfter years of confident expansion, however, Greenpeace has found that\\nmemberships in some regions are falling, particularly in the US and Sweden.\\nWorldwide revenue fell by 8 per cent between 1992 and 1993. Last month,\\nGreenpeace International, the umbrella organisation with headquarters in\\nAmsterdam, agreed to cut 10 per cent from its Dollars 30m annual budget for\\ninternational campaigning; and 10 per cent of the international staff are to\\ngo.\\nThose cuts have provoked internal opposition, in which seasoned campaigners\\nhave turned their skills of attack on each other.\\nPressure groups are more prone than rock bands to splits and schisms.\\nHowever, the savagery of the latest argument stems from the feeling among\\nsome staff that the leaders have betrayed the founders' purpose, and are\\nreplacing direct action with quasi-academic research. 'The bureaucrats have\\ntaken over. They've reached 40-something and they want a quiet life,' one\\nformer staff member said.\\nParticular venom has been directed at Lord Melchett, the 46-year-old former\\nLabour Cabinet member and executive director of Greenpeace UK. He began two\\nyears ago to haul the UK branch through the transformation on which\\nGreenpeace International is now embarking, arguing that 'the world in which\\nwe work has changed'.\\nAlthough Norway resumed commercial whaling in spite of a 1986 international\\nban, and Japan catches several hundred whales a year for 'research', there\\nare now many fewer such ships to chase. Sea-dumping of radioactive waste was\\nbanned almost worldwide under an amendment to the London Convention in\\nFebruary. Industrialised countries have agreed to phase out production of\\nmany chemicals which damage the ozone layer of the atmosphere under the 1987\\nMontreal Protocol. Perhaps most importantly, more than 150 countries\\nacknowledged at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit that the risk of global warming\\nand loss of species were worth attention.\\nThis legislative flurry has usurped some territory on which Greenpeace made\\nits most popular stands. In order to keep attracting attention, McTaggart\\nhas urged it to consider 'the gray (sic) area between violence and\\nnon-violence . . . I am not suggesting we go violent . . . (but) we need to\\ninvestigate ways of making our campaigns heavier'.\\nIts marine bias may prove a handicap to its appeal, however: it campaigns\\neasily and rapidly against drift net fishing, oil tanker spills and whaling,\\nbut does little work on tropical forests, in spite of their popular appeal.\\nRecent campaigns suggest that the group is moving further from public\\npassions. Last year Greenpeace took its campaign against the start-up of the\\nUK's Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant campaigns to the High Court, at\\nconsiderable financial risk. Yet Melchett acknowledges that it was not, at\\nleast initially, of great concern to the group's supporters.\\nAs Wilkinson puts it: 'For years they've been looking for 'the new whale' -\\nthey need to translate the image of the ship chasing the whale into the\\n1990s. But problems now are more technical.'\\nThe UK branch, in recognition of that task, appointed Chris Rose as campaign\\ndirector two years ago. A 38-year-old former biologist, he argues that\\nGreenpeace must provide answers as well as attacks.\\nHe calls this approach 'solution intervention', a phrase which staff grumble\\nis 'hardly a banner to march under'. But the old guard has cautiously\\nwelcomed a campaign, launched last month, which typifies the new strategy.\\nDubbed 'Greenfreeze', it is a 'green' supermarket freezer, designed in\\nconsultation with industry, and containing coolants which do not damage the\\nozone layer. Recently, a 70ft-truck bearing the slogan 'Tesco's freezers\\nwreck the planet', containing a demonstration of 'planet-friendly freezers',\\nhas been touring the UK.\\nThe change of direction represented by Greenfreeze is a courageous surrender\\nof some of the romance and adrenalin of the early days. It remains to be\\nseen, however, whether such campaigns will catch the public's interest.\\nMoreover, a move from emotive slogans such as 'Save the whale' to a more\\nanalytical style will draw attention to the weaknesses of Greenpeace's\\nideas.\\nFor a start, it has great difficulty in ranking some environmental threats\\nabove others, a discrimination which governments must make as resources to\\ncombat pollution are limited.\\nAt heart, this stems from a quarrel with the nature of scientific proof,\\naccording to which accepted theories are repeatedly revised in the light of\\nnew evidence.\\nThere is, nonetheless, such a thing as scientific knowledge: some theories\\nare persistently better than others at explaining events. But while\\nGreenpeace will accept research that a substance is harmful, they will\\naccept no evidence that a substance is safe. Further studies, they say,\\nmight reveal undetected damage. The consequence is that no one can ever show\\nthat enough has been done.\\nA second source of incoherence is in Greenpeace's ambivalence about economic\\ngrowth. Many campaigners appear to regard the notion of an\\nenvironmentally-friendly industry as a contradiction in terms. Melchett\\nsays, for example, that the group's goal in campaigning against toxic\\ndischarges is for 'zero discharges of any kind - clean production'. Asked if\\nthis is a reasonable target to set industry, he shrugs and says: 'I'm happy\\nfor companies to complain that it's not.'\\nPerhaps the biggest equivocation concerns trade. Last year Greenpeace\\ncirculated a manifesto calling for 'environmental protection (to be) the\\nover-riding goal of trade rules' such as the General Agreement on Tariffs\\nand Trade. It urges all countries to be more self-sufficient. But many\\ndeveloping countries argue that such principles prevent them raising living\\nstandards, and set 'green' concerns above the health and hopes of some of\\nthe poorest people on earth.\\nSuch stances imply that many in Greenpeace are uncomfortable with the\\nexistence of people, given that most human activities pollute the\\nenvironment. Those contradictions now confront Greenpeace as it seeks to\\nstep beyond its traditional role of simply registering opposition to\\ngovernment and business.\\nThe mission which McTaggart bestowed on Greenpeace was 'to get our world\\ninto the 21st century in one piece'. Five years from the millennium, the\\nworld looks likely to keep going.\\nIt is less clear that Greenpeace's sense of mission and its public support\\nwill survive.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJuly 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: THIS ONE-MAN TEAM IS NOT ALONE THIS TIME \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t the finest two minutes and 11 seconds of Frank Wattles\\' life, but it \\nwill have to do for now. Look at it this way: at least there was someone else \\nin the pool, which is a bit of a change for this loneliest of swimmers. \\n\\n\\nFresh from a flu bout, limping noticeably on a sprained ankle, Wattles, a \\nmember of the modest Mission Viejo Aquatics Club, climbed atop the starting \\nplatform for the first event of the 1989 U.S. Olympic Festival -- the 200-meter \\nindividual medley -- and proceeded to finish seventh in a race he considers his \\nspecialty. As debuts go, it wasn\\'t exactly what he had in mind. \\n\\n\\nThen again, Wattles\\' swim career hasn\\'t gone exactly as planned. At 18, he \\nfinds himself swimming against conventional wisdom, the result, in part, of a \\nnasty departure several years ago from the acclaimed Mission Viejo Nadadores. \\nLawsuits were filed. Allegiances were changed. Caught in the middle was \\nWattles, who essentially now trains for and by himself. The Aquatics Club? \\nExcept for the occasional workout partners, Wattles is the men\\'s team. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s kind of like Rocky,\" he said Tuesday evening. \\n\\n\\nAs best as Wattles knows, he is the only elite-category swimmer in the country \\nwho does a solo training act. It is a lonely existence: a morning schedule that \\nincludes stretching exercises, weightlifting and running, followed by an \\nafternoon schedules that features lots of work on stroke techniques. Swimming \\nis a solitary sport to begin with -- you against the second hand -- but imagine \\nthe discipline needed to compete against phantoms every day. \\n\\n\\nHis father, Frank Wattles III, coaches the Aquatics Club and its most \\ncelebrated member. He tinkers with his son\\'s strokes, trying always to \\nstreamline the effort needed to move 175 pounds through a lane of water. It \\nisn\\'t an easy chore, a fact not lost on area swim coaches who, according to the \\nyounger Wattles, have tried to recruit the talented medley swimmer. \\n\\n\\nThey\\'re wasting their time -- Wattles & Son is here to stay. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m fine where I am now,\" he said. \"I choose to do it the way I am.\" \\n\\n\\nIgnore Tuesday night\\'s results at the newly christened Oklahoma City Community \\nCollege pool, and Wattles has done quite nicely. He won the 100-yard backstroke \\nat this year\\'s Junior Olympics championships and the 100-yard freestyle at the \\nJunior Olympics in 1988. The Junior Olympics is generally regarded as the most \\ncompetitive 18-and-under meet in the country. \\n\\n\\nNow this. Now he finds himself, curiously enough, assigned to the North team \\nhere at the Festival. At last, teammates and the chance to swim a relay. It is \\nan odd, wonderful feeling. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s fun,\" he said. \"It\\'s a new thing. I haven\\'t been in anything like this.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd the most memorable moment of it all? \\n\\n\\n\"Being on a national team and getting free sweats,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nDespite his many successes -- and the free wardrobe -- Wattles said his \\ntraining methods are not for everyone. Actually, he said, they\\'re not for \\nanyone. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s kind of me, I kind of like it,\" he said, \"but I wouldn\\'t recommend it to \\nanyone else.\" \\n\\n\\nFather and son were together again Tuesday night. Wattles III was the one with \\nthe video camera and the encouraging smile after the seventh-place finish. \\nWattles IV was the one with the limp. \\n\\n\\n\"Frank is good to work with,\" said the elder Wattles. \"He does a good job. But \\nhe could have been better prepared for this.\" \\n\\n\\nTwo healthy ankles would have helped, as would would have a flu-less June. But \\nsome things can\\'t be helped, so Wattles did what he could. Too bad it had to be \\nseventh. \\n\\n\\nWattles, who spent last semester at Saddleback College, plans to take his swim \\nstroke to USC soon. That should be interesting: a coach who isn\\'t a blood \\nrelative, a 50-meter rather than 25-meter-long pool to conduct his training, a \\nmore demanding training schedule. And someone to swim with. \\n\\n\\nBy the way, there are signs that Wattles\\' attitude toward solitary training is \\nsoftening. Bored with a post-swim interview, he asked to be excused so he could \\nwatch, of all things, his North teammates compete. And later, in the final \\nevent of the evening -- the 400-meter freestyle relay -- Wattles did something \\nhe couldn\\'t do by himself: earn a gold medal.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSWIMMER OF PAST IN WAVE OF FUTURE; \\n\\n\\nOLYMPIC SWIMMING: THIRTY-PLUS SANDY NEILSON-BELL SEEKS ANOTHER OLYMPIC MEDAL, \\nCASH PURSES FOR SWIMMERS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a joyous interlude in an otherwise tragic event. The Munich Olympics, \\nforever remembered for the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes, also were the Games \\nthat brought swimmer Sandy Neilson\\'s tears to millions of living rooms. \\n\\n\\nAfter upsetting world record-holder Shane Gould of Australia in the 100-meter \\nfreestyle, Neilson, then a 16-year-old student at El Monte High, climbed to the \\ntop step of the medal platform and waited for Avery Brundage, president of the \\nInternational Olympic Committee, to hang the gold medal around her neck. \\n\\n\\nAnd as she waited, she cried. \\n\\n\\nHalf her lifetime later, Sandy Neilson-Bell is often reminded of that day. But \\nnow, the reminders are likely to be colored by a different kind of irony \\nbecause Neilson-Bell has dedicated herself to erasing the last vestiges of the \\nanachronistic amateurism the late Brundage had so long personified. \\n\\n\\n\"Swimmers have always had to choose between swimming and making a living,\" \\nNeilson-Bell says. \"I want to help pave the way for other athletes to make a \\nliving from swimming; to help swimmers catch up with other sports.\" \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s an imposing task. When tennis players fought to turn professional, the \\nbattle divided the sport. When a maverick pack of distance runners challenged \\nthe amateur rules governing their sport, it took years of legal arguments to \\nsolve the issue. Toward their goal, Neilson-Bell and her husband have studied \\nthe processes by which such sports as track and field have permitted cash \\nprizes. \\n\\n\\n\"Sandy would like to see swimmers coming right out of college and getting paid. \\nAnd she\\'s got a point,\" says Ingrid Daland, director of the Daland Swim Center \\nin Thousand Oaks and a former West German national swim champion. \"The top West \\nGermans are getting 1,200-1,600 marks (about $715-$950) a month. Even swimmers \\nat just the national level get free transportation to events, free sweats. . . \\n. \\n\\n\\n\"Amateurism is out the door in Europe. Why should we have amateurism?\" \\n\\n\\nThe fact that a new era of athletic perestroika has taken root in Europe, \\ndragging even the Olympic movement itself into the 20th Century, has convinced \\nNeilson-Bell it\\'s only a matter of time before U.S. swimming is forced to \\nchange. \\n\\n\\nTime is another concept Neilson-Bell has decided to challenge. Rather than \\ntrying to champion the idea of diving for dollars from afar, she is testing the \\nwaters herself as part of a comeback she hopes will lead to a berth on the 1992 \\nOlympic team. \\n\\n\\nShe\\'ll be 36 then, and while thirtysomething might be a trendy age for \\ntelevision, for swimmers it conjures up images of rocking chairs and denture \\ncream. \\n\\n\\nConsider: \\n\\n\\n* The 1984 U. S. women\\'s swimming team was the oldest ever -- with an average \\nage of only 18 1/2. \\n\\n\\n* No U. S. swimmer older than 27 has ever won a gold medal, and that swimmer, \\nFrances Schroth, got hers on a relay team in the 1920 Games, when the Olympics \\nwere little more than a dual meet between the United States and Great Britain. \\n\\n\\n* Before Neilson-Bell, no woman older than 30 had ever ranked among the top six \\nin the world in any event. \\n\\n\\nNeilson-Bell isn\\'t the only old-timer working toward a berth on the Olympic \\nteam. Mark Spitz, 39, who set seven world records in Munich, made a splash when \\nhe announced his comeback plans last fall. \\n\\n\\nBut while Spitz\\'s \"grab\" start once made him the quickest swimmer off the \\nblocks, he hit the water second this time. \\n\\n\\n\"Sandy came first,\" protests her husband, Keith Bell, a sports psychologist. \"I \\ndon\\'t know whether Mark noticed it or not, but Sandy paved the way.\" \\n\\n\\nIt was Bell, a former Division III All-American swimmer at Kenyon (Ohio) \\nCollege, who first convinced Neilson-Bell she wasn\\'t washed up. The pair first \\nmet at a coaches\\' convention nearly eight years ago, where Bell had come to \\ndeliver a motivational talk. Later, they talked before a national Masters meet, \\nwhere Bell brought up the idea of a serious comeback. \\n\\n\\n\"He encouraged me to get back into it again,\" remembers Neilson-Bell, who lives \\nin Ventura. \"He said, \\'I think you should go for \\'88.\\' Actually, he said he \\nthought I could win (the Olympic Trials).\" \\n\\n\\nApparently, Bell was off by an Olympiad because if Neilson-Bell\\'s comeback \\ncontinues apace, she could enter the 1992 Trials as the favorite in the \\n50-meter freestyle. In 1984, she just missed qualifying for the Trials and four \\nyears later, she was a Trials finalist, finishing seventh in 26.04. \\n\\n\\nAnd although she missed the team to Seoul by .54 seconds, Neilson-Bell\\'s time \\nat the Trials was faster than some of the Olympic finalists\\'. \\n\\n\\n\"Nobody in the world is as efficient in the water,\" Bell says. \"She\\'s got a \\nperfect stroke.\" And while a perfect stroke might be bad news to some senior \\ncitizens, it\\'s a priceless plus to a senior swimmer. \\n\\n\\nExperience, though, not form, could be Neilson-Bell\\'s biggest asset. \\n\\n\\n\"I personally believe you have an advantage in that you are training smarter,\" \\nDaland says of older competitors. \"You don\\'t make excuses. You just do it. \\n\\n\\n\"Basically, we know we aren\\'t going downhill physically. At least not until age \\n35. We\\'re at our physical peak. There\\'s no reason why we shouldn\\'t be swimming \\nat that age.\" \\n\\n\\nWell, maybe one reason. Money. \\n\\n\\n\"Swimming\\'s always been a young person\\'s sport,\" Bell says, \"but I always \\nthought that was for financial and sociological reasons. It\\'s hard to support \\nyourself and continue swimming when you get out of school.\" \\n\\n\\nAs evidence that age is not the ultimate factor, Neilson-Bell continues to \\nimprove on personal bests set 17 years ago. \\n\\n\\nShe shattered the Olympic 100-meter record of 58.59 -- and came within .09 \\nseconds of the world record -- in her Munich win before retiring at age 16. But \\nsince starting her comeback, she has lowered her 100 best to 57.3, and has \\nclocked 26.0 in the 50 free, an event that made its Olympic debut in 1988. \\n\\n\\n\"I feel so much stronger now than I did when I was 16,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nThe reasons Neilson-Bell left competitive swimming in the first place were more \\nmental than physical. Which is why her husband has been so important to her \\ncomeback. \\n\\n\\n\"After \\'72, I had trouble setting goals,\" she said. \"So many people were \\nsaying, \\'What can you possibly do after three gold medals?\\' It seemed like \\nwhatever I would do, I had to top that. And that was a lot of pressure.\" \\n\\n\\nAfter graduating in the top 5% of her class at El Monte High, Neilson-Bell \\nenrolled at UC Santa Barbara as a physical education major with plans to swim \\nfor enjoyment rather than medals. When the coach there pressured her to return \\nto serious competition, she responded by taking up the least serious sport she \\ncould find -- inner-tube water polo. \\n\\n\\nBut she was never far from competitive shape. In 1977, she won national \\ncollegiate championships in the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. And in 1981, the \\nfirst year she was eligible for Masters competition, she won three national \\nage-group titles. Next came the meeting with Bell, which really set the \\ncomeback in motion. \\n\\n\\n\"I see my role with Sandy as convincing her how good she is,\" says Bell, 41, \\nwho has written six books and more than 75 articles for professional journals \\non sports psychology. \"A lot of it is just keeping her head in the water.\" \\n\\n\\nOne way Bell does that is by making swimming seem like fun instead of work. \\n\\n\\n\"We never talk about \\'working out,\\' \" says Bell. \"We talk about \\'playing\\' \\nswimming.\" \\n\\n\\nThe word \"pain\" is strictly prohibited around the pool, where workouts have \\nbeen replaced by practice. Obstacles and roadblocks are referred to as \\n\"challenges,\" and one doesn\\'t make sacrifices for sport, but \"choices.\" \\n\\n\\n\"Swimmers train harder than any other athletes in the world,\" Bell says. \"The \\ntraining is so intense it tends to be viewed as the dues people have to pay; as \\na necessary evil. And it doesn\\'t have to be that way.\" \\n\\n\\nIn one of their first training sessions together, Neilson-Bell took a look at \\nthe workout. . . er, practice Bell had planned for her and flinched. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if I can do all that,\" she said. \\n\\n\\n\"Out of the pool,\" Bell snapped back. \"The practice is over.\" \\n\\n\\n\"No, wait, I\\'ll swim,\" she said. \"I\\'ll try it.\" \\n\\n\\n\"Then try it tomorrow when you can do it with a positive attitude.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n920727\\n\\n\\nFT  27 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: US makes an early strike for gold /\\nA look behind the scenes at swimming precedes disappointment for Britain\\n\\n\\nEVEN before the sparkling Piscines Bernat Picornell had been filled with\\nwater, it was obvious that yesterday's men's 100 metres breaststroke would\\nbe the most competitive swimming event at the Olympic Games. Nine of the\\nfastest times ever had been set within the past 12 months, so that Nelson\\nMandela's presence in the VIP box merely added to the electric atmosphere at\\npoolside.\\nAs things turned out, Britain's hopes of a fast start to the Games quickly\\nfizzled out in the breaststroke final. Nick Gillingham, the world's fastest\\nman this year, and Adrian Moorhouse - defending the title he won in Seoul\\nfour years ago - could only finish 7th and 8th respectively. Nelson Diebel\\nof the US took the gold medal in an Olympic record of 61.5 seconds.\\nGillingham, 25, whose Commonwealth record of 61.33secs at the trials left\\nhim top of the world rankings, was the most disappointing, though his effort\\ncould have been affected by a long-term groin strain which caused trouble\\nagain after yesterday's heats and needed physiotherapy.\\nGillingham had apparently considered pulling out after finishing fourth\\nfastest qualifier, to save himself for the 200m breaststroke. Instead, he\\ntook the plunge and was always struggling to keep up.\\nMoorhouse, meanwhile, had entered the Games as an underdog after failing to\\nrecord a fast time this year, and was unable to repeat anything like his\\nbest - 61.49secs - trailing home last in 62.33secs.\\nHungarian swimmer Norbert Rozsa's current world record of 61.33secs looked\\nvulnerable, but survived. Among team-mates, Rozsa is known as 'Richie'\\nbecause of his striking facial resemblance to the young Richard Burton.\\nHow Hungary has retained its traditional power in swimming is one of the\\nminor mysteries of post-Cold War sport. Training camps in San Diego and\\nMauritius appear to present no financial problem. In 1991 the 11-strong\\nHungarian squad broke six world records, while the rest of the world's\\nswimmers managed only eight between them.\\nMoorhouse's muscular style seems to have been adopted by Dmitri Volkov of\\nthe former Soviet Union, who set the fastest qualifying time of 61.74sec. As\\nhe churned down the pool beneath the sparkling Catalan skies, Volkov seemed\\nto create whirlpoools and waves.\\nIf his horsepower were ever harnessed to Gillingham's fluid balletic style\\nthere might be a record to stand for a decade.\\nHowever, as always in swimming, there was the might of the US to consider.\\nShaven-headed Diebel, 22, had set the second fastest 100m time of 1992 and\\nlooked aggressively determined. Naturally, a freshly shaven pate - complete\\nwith razor nicks - always looks impressive.\\nAfter his victory, Diebel, who confesses to having been hooked on soft drugs\\nfrom 12 to 16, said: 'Swimming is the path by which my life was turned\\naround.'\\nIt is a fact of top-class swimming that the era of 13-year-old muppets,\\ndriven to swim hour after hour by wicked coaches, is over.\\nMost of the US women's team are over 20. Three are even married. As such,\\nthey have the chance to be interesting.\\nJenny Thompson, for example, is known around the team as a James Dean type.\\n'She goes into town, gets the job done and leaves,' said a team-mate.\\nUnfortunately, Thompson was unexpectedly beaten in the 100m freestyle final.\\nBritain's favourite female swimmer, Sharron Davies, is also struggling. At\\n29 and with Olympic memories stretching back to 1976, the leonine Davies\\nmust surely be on her swansong. In qualifying heats of the 400m medley she\\ncame last.\\nYet it is a truism that the British love nothing more than a gallant loser.\\nDavies was mobbed by cameras and microphones. Perhaps her mission as she\\nleft the pool for the Olympic village should have been to counsel the frisky\\nyoung Australian females who had performed an impromptu striptease for male\\nteam-mates. The tabloids were slavering.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nSeptember 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSWIMMING; \\n\\n\\nTEAM\\'S SPECIALTY IS GOING THE DISTANCE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA U.S. national team of distance swimmers broke the Long Beach-to-Catalina \\nchannel relay record Aug. 11, taking one-hour shifts and completing the channel \\nswim in 7 hours 2 minutes 45 seconds. \\n\\n\\nJay Wilkerson, Jim McConica, Martha Jahn, Karen Burton, Chad Hundeby and Erica \\nReetz shattered the previous record of 12 hours 22 minutes. \\n\\n\\nSo, which is more of a surprise? That the record was broken by more than five \\nhours or that there is, indeed, a national team of distance swimmers? \\n\\n\\n\"People really don\\'t know what we\\'re doing in distance swimming,\" U.S. Coach \\nPenny Dean said. \"Since we set the record as a U.S. team, I\\'ve had 15 or 20 \\nathletes contact me saying that they would like to be considered for the \\nnational team for the World Championships. These are athletes who didn\\'t even \\nknow we had a team.\" \\n\\n\\nActually, the team is still forming. \\n\\n\\nTo select a team for the Catalina crossing, Dean held a 25-kilometer qualifying \\nrace and then kept the top three men and the top three women. She worked with \\nthat group for a week, taking them to different beaches in the Los Angeles \\narea, teaching them to deal with kelp and with swimming in the dark -- things \\nthat lap swimmers don\\'t have to worry about. \\n\\n\\nBut there are other U.S. swimmers training for distance and there are several \\nmore who would like to be included on the U.S. team that will compete in the \\ndistances swims scheduled to be included with the swimming events at the World \\nChampionships in Australia in 1991. \\n\\n\\nFINA, the international governing body for swimming, will be meeting then and \\nmight vote to include distance swimming as an Olympic medal event in 1992. \\n\\n\\nAccording to Dean, FINA could decide to add the 800-meter freestyle relay for \\nwomen to the pool events as well as adding a 16-mile swim (not a relay) for \\nindividual men\\'s and women\\'s medals, even though it would probably be a \\ncompetition that the men and the women swim concurrently. \\n\\n\\nDean, who currently holds the individual records for both the English Channel \\nswim and the Catalina Channel swim, has had to retire from distance swimming \\nbecause of a problem with her left arm. She is the women\\'s swim coach and water \\npolo coach at Pomona College. \\n\\n\\nA team of women representing the Dolphin Club of San Francisco set the women\\'s \\nrelay record for swimming the English Channel last week. The Channel Swimming \\nFederation confirmed their time of 10 hours 49 minutes. \\n\\n\\nKaren Drucker, Susan Cobbe, Carol McGrath, Joani Beemsterboer, Susan Allen and \\nLisa Smith raised the money for the trip and for the official pilot and pilot \\nboat (about $2,000) and set out on what they considered an adventure and a \\nlongshot at the record. Karen Drucker in her phone call home to Los Angeles to \\nannounce the successful crossing said that it was \"interesting.\" \\n\\n\\nUSC will be the host of a college invitational swim meet, the Grand Prix, Dec. \\n1-3 at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. Darrell Fick, the USC women\\'s \\ncoach, said that he expects to have 10 schools each in men\\'s and women\\'s \\ncompetition. \\n\\n\\nSo far the men\\'s teams committed are USC, UCLA, Stanford, California, Arizona \\nState and Cal State Long Beach, and he expects to add Michigan and Texas. The \\nwomen\\'s teams committed are USC, UCLA, Stanford, California, Arizona State, \\nMichigan, Tennessee and Colorado State. \\n\\n\\nFick is attempting to put together a 50-yard match race between Tom Jager and \\nMatt Biondi, but he has a mountain of red tape to work through on that project. \\n\\n\\nThe Stanford women\\'s swim team will include Janet Evans, who has made several \\nappearances at the Belmont Plaza pool in the past as a Placentia El Dorado High \\nSchool swimmer. \\n\\n\\nEvans\\' sweep at the Pan Pacific Games in Tokyo last month followed by her sweep \\nin the Alamo Cup competition against the Soviet team in Atlanta stretched her \\nvictory streak to 25. She hasn\\'t lost a national or international race (the \\nonly ones U.S. swimming is counting or the list would be longer) since August \\nof 1987 when she lost the 800-meter freestyle in the Pan Pacific Games in \\nAustralia. \\n\\n\\nEvans lowered her world record in the 800 during the last Pan Pacific Games, \\nswimming an 8:16.22. Her world record was the second for the U.S. team on the \\nday that the swimmers set an unprecedented four. \\n\\n\\nThere have never before been four world records set on one day, although there \\nwere three set July 19, 1976, during the Olympic Games in Montreal. \\n\\n\\nMike Barrowman started it when he lowered his own world record in the 200-meter \\nbreaststroke to 2:12.89. David Wharton got his world record back with a 2:00.11 \\nin the 200-meter individual medley, and Jager got his world record back when he \\nswam a 22.12-second 50. \\n\\n\\nJager had lost his world record to Matt Biondi during the Olympic Games last \\nfall in Seoul when Biondi won the gold and Jager won the silver. They have now \\npassed the world record in the 50 back and forth five times. \\n\\n\\nJager and Biondi have raced only once since the Olympics. They were scheduled \\nto meet in the national long course meet at USC last month, but Jager was \\ndisqualified for a false start and had to leave the starting blocks to the boos \\nand angry chants of a capacity crowd who thought the official had erred. \\n\\n\\nThe disqualification of Jager from the 50-meter freestyle at the national long \\ncourse meet in Los Angeles last month brought to mind a similar unpopular false \\nstart call against Mark Spitz -- who was disqualified from a much-anticipated \\n100-meter race against Frank Heckl the last time the national meet was held at \\nUSC in 1970. \\n\\n\\nThe U.S. team victory over the Soviet team in Atlanta last month ran the U.S. \\nteam\\'s record to 6-0 over the Soviets in dual meets. The series dates back to \\n1971. In the Alamo Cup, the U.S. men won their competition, 91-78, and the U.S. \\nwomen won, 106-56. \\n\\n\\nHired to attract corporate sponsorship and sell advertising in the official \\nprogram, the Mazza Marketing Group generated $20,850 in connection with the \\nPhillips 66/U.S. Swimming Long Course National Championship swim meet held at \\nUSC last month. Most of that money will go to the swimming program at USC. \\n\\n\\nThere has been some controversy in the past weeks over whether USC is required \\nto open the pool on its campus to the public. The pool was built by McDonald\\'s \\non USC land for the 1984 Olympic Games, and, at the time, there was the \\nunderstanding that although USC would control use of the pool after the Games, \\nthere would be some public use. No one has been able to find that stipulation \\nin the contracts. \\n\\n\\nUSC has made the pool available to many local swimming organizations for both \\ntraining and meets and does allow serious lap swimmers use of the pool from 11 \\na.m. to 6 p.m. daily. However, there is no recreational swim time. Swimmers \\nmust provide proof that they are 16 or older and they must pass a swimming \\ntest. \\n\\n\\nDr. Jim Dennis, vice president of student affairs at USC, explains that the \\npool does not meet standards for a public recreational-use pool. There is no \\nshallow area. It is a 50-meter pool that ranges in depth from 6-feet-7 to 17 \\nfeet. And the lane markers are almost always in place. Users are required to \\npay $25 a semester to help cover the cost of operation. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 23, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGOING THE DISTANCE; \\n\\n\\nSWIMMER ERICA REETZ PROVES SHE\\'LL GO TO ANY LENGTH IN PURSUIT OF OLYMPIC DREAM \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nErica Reetz has revived a dream from her childhood. \\n\\n\\nAt the age of 10, Reetz wanted to swim for the United States in the Olympics. \\nIt\\'s a common dream of young swimmers, but she also had some common sense. \\n\\n\\nReetz competed for the Fullerton Aquatics Sports Team, a team she had joined \\nwhen she was 6. Also swimming for FAST at the time was 4-year-old Janet Evans. \\n\\n\\nNow, Reetz was a good swimmer -- good enough to eventually earn a scholarship \\nto Kent State. But, by 13, she believed the Olympics were out of reach. \\n\\n\\n\"There were just too many good swimmers out there,\" said Reetz, now 20. \"I knew \\nI wasn\\'t quite good enough in my events.\" \\n\\n\\nWell, Reetz has changed events. These days she concentrates on distance \\nswimming, which could get her to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. \\n\\n\\nProponents of long distance swimming hope the event will be included as a medal \\nsport in the 1992 Games. FINA, swimming\\'s international governing body, is \\nexpected to vote in 1991 on whether to add two distance events, according to \\nPenny Dean, coach of the national long distance team. \\n\\n\\nDean said that among the events that could be added are the 25-kilometer relays \\nfor men and women. (The longest relays in the 1988 Olympics were the \\nfour-by-200-meter freestyle for men and women.) The distance relays would be in \\nopen water, such as an ocean, lake or river. \\n\\n\\n\"There weren\\'t very many people interested in long distance swimming in the \\npast,\" said Dean, who also coaches women\\'s swimming at Cal Poly Pomona. \"But \\nnow more and more countries are getting involved. I think we have a good chance \\nof getting these events approved.\" \\n\\n\\nWhich could work out well for Reetz, who was a member of the national team that \\nbroke the world record in a swim to Catalina on Aug. 11. \\n\\n\\n\"I feel I have a good chance at the Olympics now,\" said Reetz, a graduate of \\nSunny Hills High School. \"There were very few people who swam these distances, \\nand most of them were over 30.\" \\n\\n\\nDean was named the national coach in October of 1988. Her experience made her a \\nnatural. She holds world records for swimming to Catalina and for swimming the \\nEnglish Channel. \\n\\n\\nHowever, Reetz didn\\'t know there was a national team until this month. \\n\\n\\nThe team was selected after the Long Beach 16-mile swim on Aug. 6. The top \\nthree men and top three women finishers made the team, which made the 26-mile \\nCatalina swim on Aug. 11. \\n\\n\\nReetz qualified by finishing third. Along with Reetz, the national team \\nincluded Chad Hundeby of Irvine, Jay Wilkerson of Florida, Jim McConica of \\nVentura, Martha Jahn of Chicago and Karen Burton, who is in the Air Force. \\n\\n\\nThe six swimmers got a crash course in teamwork. They spent the week in a hotel \\nin Long Beach and trained every day. \\n\\n\\n\"One day we went to Manhattan Beach, then the next to Laguna Beach,\" Reetz \\nsaid. \"They were trying to get us used to the different type of things that we \\nwould encounter on the swim. Like kelp.\" \\n\\n\\nThe team smashed the existing record for the Catalina swim despite being taken \\nfour miles off course by a navigational error. They finished in 7 hours 2 \\nminutes 45 seconds. \\n\\n\\nThe record for swimming from Long Beach to Catalina was 12:22.0, which was set \\nby a group of Santa Monica swimmers in 1984. The national team also beat Dean\\'s \\nindividual record time of 7:15, set in 1977. \\n\\n\\n\"I told them that our first goal was to get there, our second goal was to break \\nthe record and our third goal was to beat my time,\" Dean said. \"I told them if \\nthey didn\\'t get all three, I would make them work out the next day. Needless to \\nsay, they were pretty happy about making it.\" \\n\\n\\nThe national team members have gone their separate ways for now. Each is \\ntraining alone because there are no funds available to set up a training site. \\n\\n\\nTheir next competition is scheduled for January in Australia. FINA plans to \\nhold a trial race in conjunction with the World Championships. \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll have a better clue where we stand in January,\" Dean said. \"If enough \\ncountries show an interest, FINA will probably include the sport in the 1992 \\nOlympics.\" \\n\\n\\nReetz has enrolled at Cal State Fullerton for the fall semester and plans to \\nswim in the masters division for FAST. However, she has focused her goals on \\nlong distance swimming on the international level. \\n\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t really thought about the Olympics for seven years,\" she said. \"But \\nnow I\\'m excited about \\n\\n\\ngetting a chance. I know it will be tough. There are a lot more people getting \\ninvolved in this sport.\" \\n\\n\\nBut Reetz has gotten in on the ground floor. \\n\\n\\nReetz\\'s first experience at distance swimming was in 1983, when she was 14. \\n\\n\\nFAST Coach Martin Craig took the team to the beach to try open water swimming. \\nErica and her twin sister, Alexa, were the only ones who enjoyed the \\nexperience. \\n\\n\\n\"Everybody else hated it,\" Reetz said. \"It\\'s a lot different than swimming in a \\npool. You have to fight with the current and the water is a lot colder. It\\'s a \\nchallenge.\" \\n\\n\\nThe next year, Erica and Alexa Reetz entered the Seal Beach one-mile swim and \\nfinished tied for first in the women\\'s division. \\n\\n\\nDespite her success, Erica Reetz felt distance swimming was more of a hobby, \\nsomething to help her stay in shape. \\n\\n\\nReetz finished third in the 500-yard freestyle at the Southern Section 4-A meet \\nin 1986 and fifth in 1987. She and her sister accepted scholarships to Kent \\nState. \\n\\n\\nHowever, midway through the 1988 season, Reetz learned that Kent State was \\ndropping its swim program. \\n\\n\\nKent State officials told her she would still be on scholarship if she stayed, \\nbut Reetz decided to return to Southern California. \\n\\n\\nAfter 13 years of competitive swimming, she was tired of swimming and wanted to \\nget away from the sport. \\n\\n\\nWhat changed her mind was Orange Coast College Coach Don Watson, a close friend \\nof the family. Watson talked with Reetz throughout last summer and finally \\npersuaded her to swim for Orange Coast. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve known Erica and Alexa since they were 5 years old,\" Watson said. \"I\\'ve \\nstayed in touch and followed their careers from a distance. I had hoped they \\nwould come down and swim at Orange Coast, but they were so talented they \\nreceived an opportunity to swim at Kent State.\" \\n\\n\\nHowever, when Kent State dropped its program, Watson made contact again. Alexa \\nReetz already had decided to remain at Kent State, but Erica was undecided. \\n\\n\\nShe was actually leaning toward enrolling at Cal State Fullerton, but Watson \\ntalked her out of it. \\n\\n\\n\"Don got me interested in swimming again,\" Reetz said. \"I was really burned \\nout. I really didn\\'t think I wanted to compete anymore.\" \\n\\n\\nReetz\\'s desire to swim returned. At the community college state meet, she \\nfinished second in the 500-yard freestyle (5 minutes 1.5 seconds) and third in \\nthe 200-yard freestyle (1:55.5). \\n\\n\\nBoth were personal bests. \\n\\n\\nAt the end of the season, several colleges were interested in Reetz, but she \\nwasn\\'t interested in them. \\n\\n\\n\"If Erica had expressed an interest, I could have placed her in one of a \\nhalf-a-dozen schools,\" Watson said. \"But she was more interested in open-water \\nswimming.\" \\n\\n\\nReetz plans to spend the next three years training for the 1992 Olympics. \\nBesides swimming three days a week, she plans to lift weights regularly for the \\nfirst time. \\n\\n\\nAnd, according to Watson, she already has the natural talent. \\n\\n\\n\"In any distance under 1,500 (meters), she wouldn\\'t stand a chance,\" he said. \\n\"But the longer the race, the better, for both Erica and Alexa. I think they \\nare both in a position, physically and mentally, to take advantage of the \\nlonger distances. If they are approved.\" \\n\\n\\nReetz said she isn\\'t worried about the 1991 vote. She plans to train with the \\nOlympics as her goal. \\n\\n\\n\"All I can do is get prepared and hope,\" Reetz said. \"It\\'s my dream right now.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nSeptember 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSWIMMING; \\n\\n\\nOLYMPIANS TO GET TIME TO BREATHE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has long been said, only somewhat in jest, that the U.S. Olympic trials \\nconstitute the toughest swim meet in the world. \\n\\n\\nJust ask Andy Coan. The world record-holder in the 100-meter freestyle in 1975, \\nhe did not qualify for the Olympic team in 1976. For that matter, he didn\\'t \\nmake the eight-man field for the trials final. \\n\\n\\nThe limit on entries, two per event, and the depth of U.S. swimming conspire to \\nmake the U.S. trials more difficult than the Olympic Games themselves. \\n\\n\\nThat is expected to change at the U.S. Swimming Convention in Pittsburgh next \\nweek when the 600-member House of Delegates votes to confirm March 1-6 as the \\ndates for the 1992 U.S. Olympic trials. \\n\\n\\nPreviously, the U.S. team was selected only three or four weeks before the \\nOlympic Games. The March dates, an adaptation of the Australian system, will \\ngive the team almost four months of training together before the 1992 Games in \\nBarcelona, Spain. \\n\\n\\nThe problem with the old system, some coaches believed, was that to make the \\nhighly competitive U.S. team, swimmers were tapering -- easing up on their \\ntraining and shaving their body hair -- for the trials, then repeating the \\nprocess a few weeks later for the Olympic Games. \\n\\n\\nThe second time, many believe, the taper doesn\\'t take as effectively. \\n\\n\\n\"It takes such a big effort just to make the team and then we were asking them \\nto bounce back for the Games a month later,\" said Doug Ingram, date selection \\nchairman. \"It\\'s tough to come off that emotional high from the trials that \\nquickly.\" \\n\\n\\nBut some coaches contend that the early selection process penalizes the \"hot\" \\nswimmer, the one who peaks at the trials and continues to pick up speed through \\nthe Olympics. \\n\\n\\nIngram believes that sacrifice will have to be made. \\n\\n\\n\"We feel what\\'s best for the group outweighs the potential loss of an \\nindividual who comes on at the last minute,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nThe new system also has a major impact on collegiate swimming, since the trials \\nwill be held three to four weeks before the women\\'s and men\\'s NCAA Division I \\nchampionships. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'ll take some focus away from the NCAA championships, but what came across \\nin our meetings with college and club coaches is that in an Olympic year they \\nare willing to put aside their local concerns and put the focus on the national \\nconcern,\" said Ingram, who coaches the men\\'s team at Southern Illinois \\nUniversity. \\n\\n\\nThe conference championship meets will be affected even more, since potential \\nOlympians won\\'t taper for them. Instead, they will train hard up to and during \\nthe conference meets so that they can taper before the Olympic trials. \\n\\n\\nAs a result, some conferences, including the Pac-10 and the Southeastern, are \\nconsidering moving their conference meets from March, 1992, to December, 1991. \\n\\n\\n\"That takes the pressure off an individual who might feel that he was letting \\nhis team down by focusing on the Olympic trials,\" Ingram said. \\n\\n\\nThe system will be tested in January. For the first time, the U.S. picked a \\nnational team several months in advance. The World Championships team was \\nselected in early August and will compete Jan. 7-11 in Perth, Australia. \\n\\n\\nWhen the Mission Bay swimming program appeared on the scene in 1985 by hiring \\naway Mark Schubert from the Mission Viejo Nadadores, it appeared to be \\npatterning itself after a Nadador program that had won 44 national team titles. \\nThe club, in Boca Raton, Fla., had the facilities, the funding and the coaching \\nto attract swimmers from all over the country. \\n\\n\\nJust two years later, it lost Schubert to the University of Texas women\\'s \\nprogram and the affiliated Longhorn club. Now his successor, Steve Bultman, an \\nassistant on the 1988 Olympic team, is gone. \\n\\n\\n\"I still think Mission Bay is probably the best training facility in the \\ncountry, but I do think coaching changes have not had a stabilizing effect,\" \\nSchubert said. \"It is not on as solid a footing as it appeared to be at the \\nbeginning. The budget cuts have hurt. It never lived up to the dream it was \\nsupposed to be.\" \\n\\n\\nSchubert\\'s Longhorn club is up to 250 members, an increase of 40. More swimmers \\nare expected with the recent addition of a satellite facility, a 50-meter pool \\nin the Circle C section of Austin. \\n\\n\\nSwimming Notes \\n\\n\\nIndianapolis, Nashville, Orlando, Fla., and Oklahoma City are vying to be the \\nhost of the 1992 Olympic trials, although late bids will be accepted before the \\nvoting at the U.S. Swimming convention Sept. 23 in Pittsburgh. . . . Voting \\nwill be held there for performance of the year. Tom Jager and Mike Barrowman, \\nthe only U.S. swimmers to set world records in 1990, appear to be the best \\nbets. Jager, the former UCLA star, lowered the 50-meter freestyle mark twice on \\nMarch 24 in Nashville with a final clocking of 21.81 seconds. Barrowman \\nbettered the mark he set in August 1989 in Tokyo by a whopping 1.36 seconds, \\nthe most improvement of the 200 breaststroke record since 1976. . . . Finalists \\nfor swimmer of the year are Barrowman, Jager, Matt Biondi , Janet Evans, Melvin \\nStewart, Eric Namesnik, Leigh Ann Fetter and Nicole Haislett. Jon Urbanchek of \\nthe University of Michigan, formerly coach at Cal State Long Beach, was named \\ncoach of the year by the American Swimming Coaches Assn. at itsconvention last \\nweek in Washington. Urbanchek is credited with having developed Barrowman. . . \\n. Olympic gold medalist Mark Spitz is at the Olympic Training Center in \\nColorado Springs, Colo., for tests at the International Center for Aquatic \\nResearch. Spitz plans to swim in the flume, the only swimming treadmill in the \\nWestern Hemisphere. His stroke efficiency and swimming economy, a gauge of how \\nefficiently he uses oxygen, will be measured and compared to future tests. . . \\n. On Saturday, Spitz and members of Indiana\\'s six NCAA championship teams, 1968 \\nthrough \\'73, will meet in Bloomington, Ind., for a reunion. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSWIMMER OF PAST IN WAVE OF FUTURE; \\n\\n\\nCOMEBACK: THIRTY-PLUS SANDY NEILSON-BELL SEEKS ANOTHER OLYMPIC MEDAL, CASH \\nPURSES FOR SWIMMERS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was a joyous interlude in an otherwise tragic event. The Munich Olympics, \\nforever remembered for the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes, also were the Games \\nthat brought swimmer Sandy Neilson\\'s tears to millions of living rooms. \\n\\n\\nAfter upsetting world record-holder Shane Gould of Australia in the 100-meter \\nfreestyle, Neilson, then 16, climbed to the top step of the medal platform and \\nwaited for Avery Brundage, president of the International Olympic Committee, to \\nhang the gold medal around her neck. \\n\\n\\nAnd as she waited, she cried. \\n\\n\\nHalf her lifetime later, Sandy Neilson-Bell is often reminded of that day. But \\nnow, the reminders are likely to be colored by a different kind of irony \\nbecause Neilson-Bell has dedicated herself to erasing the last vestiges of the \\nanachronistic amateurism the late Brundage had so long personified. \\n\\n\\n\"Swimmers have always had to choose between swimming and making a living,\" \\nNeilson-Bell says. \"I want to help pave the way for other athletes to make a \\nliving from swimming; to help swimmers catch up with other sports.\" \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s an imposing task. When tennis players fought to turn professional, the \\nbattle divided the sport. When a maverick pack of distance runners challenged \\nthe amateur rules governing their sport, it took years of legal arguments to \\nsolve the issue. Toward their goal, Neilson-Bell and her husband have studied \\nthe processes by which such sports as track and field have permitted cash \\nprizes. \\n\\n\\n\"Sandy would like to see swimmers coming right out of college and getting paid. \\nAnd she\\'s got a point,\" says Ingrid Daland, director of the Daland Swim Center \\nin Thousand Oaks and a former West German national swim champion. \"The top West \\nGermans are getting 1,200-1,600 marks (about $715-$950)a month. Even swimmers \\nat just the national level get free transportation to events, free sweats . . . \\n. \\n\\n\\n\"Amateurism is out the door in Europe. Why should we have amateurism?\" \\n\\n\\nThe fact that a new era of athletic perestroika has taken root in Europe, \\ndragging even the Olympic movement itself into the 20th Century, has convinced \\nNeilson-Bell it\\'s only a matter of time before U.S. swimming is forced to \\nchange. \\n\\n\\nTime is another concept Neilson-Bell has decided to challenge. Rather than \\ntrying to champion the idea of diving for dollars from afar, she is testing the \\nwaters herself as part of a comeback she hopes will lead to a berth on the 1992 \\nOlympic team. \\n\\n\\nShe\\'ll be 36 then, and while thirtysomething might be a trendy age for \\ntelevision, for swimmers it conjures up images of rocking chairs and denture \\ncream. \\n\\n\\nConsider: \\n\\n\\n* The 1984 U. S. women\\'s swimming team was the oldest ever -- with an average \\nage of only 18 1/2. \\n\\n\\n* No U. S. swimmer older than 27 has ever won a gold medal, and that swimmer, \\nFrances Schroth, got hers on a relay team in the 1920 Games, when the Olympics \\nwere little more than a dual meet between the United States and Great Britain. \\n\\n\\n* Before Neilson-Bell, no woman older than 30 had ever ranked among the top six \\nin the world in any event. \\n\\n\\nNeilson-Bell isn\\'t the only relative old-timer working toward a berth on the \\nOlympic team. Mark Spitz, 39, who set seven world records in Munich, made a \\nsplash when he announced his comeback plans last fall. \\n\\n\\nBut while Spitz\\'s \"grab\" start once made him the quickest swimmer off the \\nblocks, he hit the water second this time. \\n\\n\\n\"Sandy came first,\" protests her husband, Keith Bell, a sports psychologist. \"I \\ndon\\'t know whether Mark noticed it or not, but Sandy paved the way.\" \\n\\n\\nIt was Bell, a former Division III All-American swimmer at Kenyon (Ohio) \\nCollege, who first convinced Neilson-Bell she wasn\\'t washed up. The pair first \\nmet at a coaches\\' convention nearly eight years ago, where Bell had come to \\ndeliver a motivational talk. Later, they talked before a national Masters meet, \\nwhere Bell brought up the idea of a serious comeback. \\n\\n\\n\"He encouraged me to get back into it again,\" remembers Neilson-Bell, who lives \\nin Ventura. \"He said, \\'I think you should go for \\'88.\\' Actually, he said he \\nthought I could win (the Olympic Trials).\" \\n\\n\\nApparently, Bell was off by an Olympiad because if Neilson-Bell\\'s comeback \\ncontinues apace, she could enter the 1992 Trials as the favorite in the \\n50-meter freestyle. In 1984, she just missed qualifying for the Trials and four \\nyears later, she was a Trials finalist, finishing seventh in 26.04. \\n\\n\\nAnd although she missed the team to Seoul by .54 seconds, Neilson-Bell\\'s time \\nat the Trials was faster than some of the Olympic finalists\\'. \\n\\n\\n\"Nobody in the world is as efficient in the water,\" Bell says. \"She\\'s got a \\nperfect stroke.\" And while a perfect stroke might be bad news to some senior \\ncitizens, it\\'s a priceless plus to a senior swimmer. \\n\\n\\nExperience, though, not form, could be Neilson-Bell\\'s biggest asset. \\n\\n\\n\"I personally believe you have an advantage in that you are training smarter,\" \\nDaland says of older competitors. \"You don\\'t make excuses. You just do it. \\n\\n\\n\"Basically, we know we aren\\'t going downhill physically. At least not until age \\n35. We\\'re at our physical peak. There\\'s no reason why we shouldn\\'t be swimming \\nat that age.\" \\n\\n\\nWell, maybe one reason. Money. \\n\\n\\n\"Swimming\\'s always been a young person\\'s sport,\" Bell says , \"but I always \\nthought that was for financial and sociological reasons. It\\'s hard to support \\nyourself and continue swimming when you get out of school.\" \\n\\n\\nAs evidence that age is not the ultimate factor, Neilson-Bell continues to \\nimprove on personal bests set 17 years ago. \\n\\n\\nShe shattered the Olympic 100-meter record of 58.59 -- and came within .09 \\nseconds of the world record -- in her Munich win before retiring at age 16. But \\nsince starting her comeback, she has lowered her 100 best to 57.3, and has \\nclocked 26.0 in the 50 free, an event that made its Olympic debut in 1988. \\n\\n\\n\"I feel so much stronger now than I did when I was 16,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nThe reasons Neilson-Bell left competitive swimming in the first place were more \\nmental than physical. Which is why her husband has been so important to her \\ncomeback. \\n\\n\\n\"After \\'72, I had trouble setting goals,\" she said. \"So many people were \\nsaying, \\'What can you possibly do after three gold medals?\\' It seemed like \\nwhatever I would do, I had to top that. And that was a lot of pressure.\" \\n\\n\\nAfter graduating in the top 5% of her class at El Monte High, Neilson-Bell \\nenrolled at UC Santa Barbara as a physical education major with plans to swim \\nfor enjoyment rather than medals. When the coach there pressured her to return \\nto serious competition, she responded by taking up the least serious sport she \\ncould find -- inner-tube water polo. \\n\\n\\nBut she was never far from competitive shape. In 1977, she won national \\ncollegiate championships in the 50- and 100-yard freestyles. And in 1981, the \\nfirst year she was eligible for Masters competition, she won three national \\nage-group titles. Next came the meeting with Bell, which really set the \\ncomeback in motion. \\n\\n\\n\"I see my role with Sandy as convincing her how good she is,\" says Bell, 41, \\nwho has written six books and more than 75 articles for professional journals \\non sports psychology. \"A lot of it is just keeping her head in the water.\" \\n\\n\\nOne way Bell does that is by making swimming seem like fun instead of work. \\n\\n\\n\"We never talk about \\'working out,\\' \" says Bell. \"We talk about \\'playing\\' \\nswimming.\" \\n\\n\\nThe word \"pain\" is strictly prohibited around the pool, where workouts have \\nbeen replaced by practice. Obstacles and roadblocks are referred to as \\n\"challenges,\" and one doesn\\'t make sacrifices for sport, but \"choices.\" \\n\\n\\n\"Swimmers train harder than any other athletes in the world,\" Bell says. \"The \\ntraining is so intense it tends to be viewed as the dues people have to pay; as \\na necessary evil. And it doesn\\'t have to be that way.\" \\n\\n\\nIn one of their first training sessions together, Neilson-Bell took a look at \\nthe workout. . . er, practice Bell had planned for her and flinched. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if I can do all that,\" she said. \\n\\n\\n\"Out of the pool,\" Bell snapped back. \"The practice is over.\" \\n\\n\\n\"No, wait, I\\'ll swim,\" she said. \"I\\'ll try it.\" \\n\\n\\n\"Then try it tomorrow when you can do it with a positive attitude.\" \\n\\n\\nA positive attitude should help Neilson-Bell in her effort to reform swimming \\nbecause it doesn\\'t figure to happen overnight. In fact, some say she\\'s doing \\nlittle more than tilting at windmills, though recent developments have \\nencouraged her. \\n\\n\\nLast December, Olympians Matt Biondi and Tom Jager staged a prize-money match \\nrace over 50 yards at the Belmont Plaza pool in Long Beach, marking the first \\ntime swimmers openly competed for a cash purse in this country. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t see why swimmers can\\'t not only defray the costs of their training and \\ntravel, but also make a living from swimming,\" says Neilson-Bell, who ran up a \\ndebt of nearly $40,000 training for her shot at the 1988 Games. \\n\\n\\nJeff Diamond, the information services director for US Swimming, the sport\\'s \\ngoverning body in the United States, agrees. But he is not optimistic the \\nsituation will change soon. \\n\\n\\n\"Unfortunately,\" he says, \"there\\'s not a great pinata in the sky that everyone \\ncan take a whack at.\" \\n\\n\\nUS Swimming operates on a $5 million annual budget which, with nearly 200,000 \\nregistered competitors nationwide, gives it the leanest staff-to-athlete ratio \\nof any Olympic sport. But while swimming has taken off as a participant sport, \\nit has suffered as a spectator sport, limiting its ability to generate much \\nincome from gate receipts and making it difficult to negotiate sizable TV \\ncontracts. \\n\\n\\nAthletes and coaches, however, blame the bureaucrats for not doing more to \\npromote the sport. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s basically the U. S. swimming governing body that has been slow to \\nchange,\" says Neilson-Bell, who is also coach of the Pleasant Valley Swim Club \\nin Camarillo. \\n\\n\\nSlowly but surely, however, Neilson-Bell is convinced swimming\\'s era of inertia \\nis over. She swam for the gold once and it brought tears to her eyes. Now she \\nwants a chance to swim for the green. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

The \\nnonprofit foundation was established in 1987 to raise money for the facility. \\n\\n\\nThe center, the country\\'s first warm weather, year-round training center, will \\nbe the third operated by the United States Olympic Committee. The Olympic \\nCommittee also operates training centers at its headquarters in Colorado \\nSprings and Lake Placid, N.Y. \\n\\n\\nThe Olympic Committee \"is excited about the prospect of the new Olympic \\nTraining Center in San Diego because we finally have a state-of-the-art \\nfacility in California where a huge number of our 1992 Olympic team members \\ncurrently live,\" said Robert L. Helmick, president of the committee. \\n\\n\\n\"In the past, California has on several occasions provided as many as one-third \\nof the members of our summer Olympic teams.\" \\n\\n\\nThe first phase will give particular emphasis to Olympic sports not fully \\nserved at existing training centers, including archery, track and field, \\ncanoe-kayaking, cycling, field hockey, soccer, and water polo. \\n\\n\\nTo support these sports, the complex will house a sports medicine and testing \\nfacility, a boat house and a 2,000-meter regatta course, a 50-meter pool, \\nresidence for more than 300 athletes and a visitor\\'s center, Olympic officials \\nsay. \\n\\n\\nThe focal point of the visitor\\'s center will be the open-air \"Court of \\nChampions\" for ceremonies and small presentations.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEVANS WINS U.S. TITLE IN 400 IM; \\n\\n\\nTWO OTHER TEENS -- BLANCHARD, KOLE -- ALSO VICTORIOUS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter breezing to another national title in the women\\'s 400-meter individual \\nmedley Tuesday night in the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Long Course National \\nChampionships, 17-year-old Janet Evans said that she was starting to feel old. \\n\\n\\nNot that she was aching in her bones or gasping for breath. But it\\'s not the \\nsame as it was in the old days, when she swam in her first long course national \\nmeet at age 13. When she was a new kid and hung around with the other new kids, \\ngawking at the stars. \\n\\n\\nNow when she walks from the awards stand to the interview room, little girls \\nfollow along to peek in the windows. \\n\\n\\nNow she\\'s the star. \\n\\n\\nThe down side to stardom is that there is no one to push her. \\n\\n\\nShe had some competition when she won the gold medal in the 400 IM during the \\nOlympic Games in Seoul, enough to push her to a U.S. record of 4 minutes 37.76 \\nseconds. Tuesday, she won in 4:39.36 with Michelle Griglione almost eight \\nseconds behind her. \\n\\n\\nThe victory, her first of this meet, puts her on the U.S. team that will \\ncompete at the Pan Pacific Games in Tokyo and then in a dual meet against the \\nSoviets. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s kind of hard racing against the clock,\" Evans said. \"I like to have \\ncompetition. But what can you do? . . . I want to go faster at Tokyo. But there \\nprobably won\\'t be anyone there, either. I\\'ll have to do it myself.\" \\n\\n\\nWhen it was suggested that she might get some competition when she meets the \\nSoviets in Atlanta, she brightened. \\n\\n\\n\"Oh, yeah,\" she said. \"There is a Soviet girl who has a really fast 400 IM. I \\nhadn\\'t thought about that.\" \\n\\n\\nAsked if the excitement and the competition of the Olympic Games made \\neverything else seem like a letdown, Evans answered with her trademark smile \\nand shrug: \"The Olympics only come around every four years, and there are a lot \\nof other meets in between that.\" \\n\\n\\nTwo 16-year-olds won the other women\\'s events Tuesday night. \\n\\n\\nMary Ellen Blanchard (granddaughter of 1945 Heisman Trophy winner Doc \\nBlanchard) won the women\\'s 200-meter breaststroke in 2:31.59, and Julie Kole \\n(who had won the 1,500-meter freestyle Monday) won the women\\'s 200-meter \\nfreestyle in 2:00.95. \\n\\n\\nRich Schroeder, 27, a swimmer who could tell Evans what it is to feel old on \\nthe deck, won the men\\'s 100-meter breaststroke. Schroeder, who won a gold medal \\nwith the 400-meter medley relay team in Seoul, has left his job as an \\naccountant with Price Waterhouse to become a carpenter. He prefers the physical \\nwork to the hours behind the desk. But his hours for weightlifting and training \\nare still limited. \\n\\n\\nWhy does he continue to swim? \\n\\n\\n\"I continue to do it because I thrive on competition,\" Schroeder said. \\n\"Physically, I don\\'t think I was ready to go 1:02.4, but, boy, I don\\'t like to \\nget beat, so I did it. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know if (the younger guys) like me hanging around, but I want to keep \\nthem honest. They\\'ll pass me eventually, but they\\'ll have to work for it.\" \\n\\n\\nDoug Gjertsen, 22, who won two gold medals on relay teams in Seoul, has \\ncompleted a suspension for his limited involvement in the mask-napping caper in \\nKorea, and is again competing for Longhorn Aquatics. Gjertsen beat fellow \\nOlympian Melvin Stewart in the men\\'s 200-meter freestyle. \\n\\n\\nWade King, who won the men\\'s 100-meter butterfly, heard Evans saying that she \\nfelt old and commented: \"How does she think I feel?\" King is 22 and is just now \\nstarting to make his mark. \\n\\n\\nHe was thrilled with his national title and the prospect of competing for the \\nU.S. in Tokyo. So far, the highlight of his career has been competing for the \\nU.S. in the Pan Am Games in 1987 -- while Evans and company were competing at \\nthe Pan Pacific Games in Brisbane, Australia. \\n\\n\\nKing, who swam for the University of South Carolina, explains that swimming \\nthere is not as \"intense\" as swimming in California or Texas or Florida. \\n\\n\\nAsked if he planned to retire soon, he said: \"Not now. Placing the way I did, \\nI\\'ll get a lot more financial support. I\\'ll definitely be able to stay in \\nswimming another year.\" \\n\\n\\nWade\\'s time (53.72 seconds) was better than the 54.58 recorded in the \\nconsolation final by 1988 Olympic gold medalist Anthony Nesty. Because he is \\nfrom Suriname and is not a U.S. citizen, Nesty, a University of Florida \\nswimmer, was not seeded into the final of this U.S. championship meet. \\n\\n\\nCompetition will continue here through Friday. \\n\\n\\nMeet Notes \\n\\n\\nThis meet is the selection meet for the Pan Pacific Championships in Tokyo Aug. \\n17-20 and most of the swimmers will go directly from Tokyo to Atlanta for the \\nAug. 24-26 meet (the Alamo Cup) against the Soviet team. The Soviet swimmers \\nwill be coming from the European championships in Bonn, West Germany. . . . \\nMike Bottom, 33, who won the 1974 men\\'s national title in the 100-meter \\nbutterfly with a time of 55.5 seconds and went on to a berth on the 1980 U.S. \\nOlympic team, made the consolation final of the 100-meter butterfly Tuesday \\nnight swimming for the Walnut Creek Aquabears. He finished 15th in 55.44 -- a \\ntick faster than his \\'74 time. . . . Olympian Dan Jorgensen of Blue Fin Swim \\nTeam (and USC) was fourth in the men\\'s 200-meter freestyle. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 19, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSENIORS IN THE SWIM; \\n\\n\\nTROUPE PERFORMS WATER BALLET LIKE EXTRAS IN ESTHER WILLIAMS MOVIE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEileen Allen marches back and forth along the edge of the swimming pool, \\nbarking out orders on the loudspeaker. At age 74, she\\'s a formidable drill \\nsergeant in a black swimsuit. \\n\\n\\nA dozen or so women, swim caps pulled tightly over their gray hair and plastic \\nclips on their noses, paddle around the pool in a perfect circle. They extend \\ntheir arms in unison, roll over into a somersault and bob back up for air. \\n\\n\\n\"Stop! Stop!\" commands Allen, interrupting the exercise. She has spotted a \\nstray swimmer floating out of formation. \\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re way ahead of everybody!\" she admonishes. \\n\\n\\n\"She can\\'t hear you,\" comes the response from the pool. \\n\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the Army, it\\'s the Aquadettes, and the wayward swan isn\\'t the only \\none who\\'s hard of hearing. \\n\\n\\nAbout 20 residents of Leisure World in Laguna Hills belong to the synchronized \\nswimming troupe. Although most Aquadettes are in their late 70s, they don \\nsequin-trimmed bathing suits and plunge into the pool to perform their water \\nballet like extras in an Esther Williams movie. \\n\\n\\nTwo of their younger members, Barbara Pedersen and Esther Hutchings -- ages 62 \\nand 60, respectively -- recently competed in the World Masters Games in Sweden, \\nan international Olympics-style competition held once every four years for \\npeople over 25. Both took second-place medals for synchronized swimming in \\ntheir age group. \\n\\n\\nWhile the Aquadettes perform less strenuous routines than seen in competitions, \\nthey don\\'t practice just for kicks. \\n\\n\\nOn a recent Friday, they were hard at work fixing what they call \"trouble \\nspots\" for their annual Aqua Follies held at the Leisure World pool Aug. 24 \\nthrough 27. All four of the performances, with 350 seats each, sold out weeks \\nago. \\n\\n\\n\"People get excited that all these little old ladies in tennis shoes can do \\nthis,\" Pedersen says. \"We\\'re pretty good. We get out there, get our legs up, \\nand it\\'s all set to music and very pretty.\" \\n\\n\\nDuring practice, they work like professional performers. As head coach, Allen \\nhas the lonely job of whipping everyone into shape. \\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re very unpopular,\" she says of herself. \"But this time of year we don\\'t \\nworry about hurt feelings.\" \\n\\n\\nIndeed, if one or more of the Aquadettes floats out of line or misses a cue, \\ngood-natured squabbling breaks out among the women over who should do what \\nwhen. \\n\\n\\n\"One person went before someone else did and nobody knows who\\'s right,\" says \\nHutchings, watching the women bicker over the kick-line sequence for the \\n\"Chorus Line\" number. \\n\\n\\nWhen they\\'re in sync, the Aquadettes look like an aquatic version of the June \\nTaylor Dancers. At the same instant, a dozen legs shoot up out of the water, \\nfeet flexed, toes pointed. \\n\\n\\nThe Aquadettes range in age from 55 to 87. Three of them are deaf and one is \\nrecovering from a heart attack and two strokes. \\n\\n\\n\"Most women their age are sitting in front of a TV with a cat in their lap,\" \\nHutchings says. \\n\\n\\nInstead, the Aquadettes engage in what can be a demanding sport at any age. \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re among the few groups in the world who do this,\" Hutchings says. \"It\\'s a \\nhard thing to do. You have to keep from sinking, keep control, get that leg up \\nout of the water at a perfect right angle. It takes stamina.\" \\n\\n\\nAbove the water, arms and legs move gracefully. When submerged, the limbs churn \\nlike eggbeaters to keep the body afloat. \\n\\n\\nPedersen and Hutchings found synchronized swimming at the competitive level to \\nbe even more intense. At the World Games earlier this month, they had to \\nperform more complicated stunts. They would carry out two or three movements \\ninstead of one while holding their breath under water. \\n\\n\\n\"When we got done with our duet, our tongues hung down to our toenails,\" \\nPedersen says. \\n\\n\\nThey began training seriously in November with the Meraquas of Irvine, a group \\nof synchronized swimmers who train for competition. Of the 60 or so Meraquas, \\nPedersen and Hutchings are the only two in the masters category. The others \\nrange in age from 8 to 16. \\n\\n\\nIn Sweden they competed against 119 swimmers from all over the world. \\n\\n\\nIn addition to receiving second-place medals for figures (six individual \\nstunts) they won a fourth-place prize for their duet. \\n\\n\\nPedersen received a fifth-place medal for her solo in the 60- to 69-year-old \\nage group. Hutchings received fourth place for her solo in the 40- to \\n59-year-old age group (competitors were grouped according to their ages as of \\nDec. 31, 1988). \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve never been athletic,\" says Hutchings, \"and for the first time I can do \\nsomething reasonably well. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a challenge, and if you don\\'t have a challenge when you\\'re 60, you go to \\npot.\" \\n\\n\\nPedersen, too, has found synchronized swimming to be the perfect sport. \\n\\n\\n\"It gives us the fun of competition without the stress on our bodies,\" she \\nsays. \"Plus, I\\'m a bit of a ham.\" \\n\\n\\nAquadettes perform a more relaxed ballet. They\\'re in it for the camaraderie, \\nnot the competition. They form lasting friendships. Besides, swimming lowers \\ntheir blood pressure. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ve always been a swimmer and I was a competitive diver. It\\'s good exercise. \\nIt keeps you limber,\" says Helen Balch, 71, who will perform in her 14th \\nAquadette show. \\n\\n\\nAquadettes must be residents of the Leisure World retirement community. That\\'s \\nthe only requirement for joining the troupe. \\n\\n\\n\"Anyone can do it,\" Pedersen says. \"We have women who have learned to swim at \\nLeisure World, and we\\'ve had former Olympic swimmers.\" \\n\\n\\nThey have been performing since 1965, almost as long as Leisure World has been \\nin existence. At their upcoming show, they will pay tribute to the community\\'s \\n25th birthday by assembling an eight-foot birthday cake, complete with lit \\ncandles. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

In\\nother cases a glance at the calendar provides its own brutal conclusion.\\nEvelyn Ashford is going of her own accord. The US 100 metres runner has been\\namong the best-loved of that country's galaxy of sprinters.\\nNow 35, she first competed at the 1976 Montreal Games, coming fifth in the\\n100m. She holds the second-fastest time ever for the distance and has broken\\n11 seconds 33 times.\\nAt the Los Angeles Games Ashford won two gold medals, taking another in the\\n4x100m relay in Seoul. Watch for a tidal wave of emotion in the big stadium\\nwhen she runs her final relay tomorrow.\\nFate has been less kind to another, equally talented, female runner. Ana\\nQuirot has had the misfortune to be Cuban in a decade when politics have\\nbeen as big a factor at the Olympics as the stopwatch.\\nSince the early 1980s she has been winning World Cups and Pan-American\\ntitles. What Ana did not do, because of boycotts, was run in the Los Angeles\\nor Seoul Games. Barcelona was her first Olympics, and a bronze medal was the\\nbest this fine athlete could manage.\\nOne must wonder if Carl Lewis will thrill another Olympic stadium? He had\\nsome claim to bad luck in the sprint trials for the US team but a look at\\nLinford Christie's gold medal in the 100m gives a clue to their joint\\nfutures.\\nAt 32 Christie was older by four years than any previous 100m champion and\\nhis chances of repeating the triumph in four years' time, in Atlanta, must\\nbe minuscule. Lewis is just a few months younger than the British star.\\nPredicting the age at which swimmers need to find another pool has become\\nrisky. Money has kept mature swimmers such as US hero Matt Biondi in the\\nwater far longer than one would have predicted at Seoul, where he won seven\\nmedals, five of them gold. Biondi has won two gold medals in Barcelona. 'If\\nyou've been around the block, you know how to go around the block,' shrugs\\nBiondi, 26.\\nBritish swimming stars Adrian Moorhouse and Sharron Davies have both\\nannounced their goodbyes to Olympic competition. Both have been British\\nswimming's only instantly recognisable characters and the sport will miss\\ntheir charisma.\\nOn top of the water rather than in it, Barcelona seems certain to sound the\\nswansong for Italy's extraordinary Abbagnale brothers. Rowing has seldom\\nseen a duo such as Giuseppe, 33, and Carmine, 30.\\nIn the coxed pairs they have won seven of the last nine world championships\\nand came to Barcelona looking for their third consecutive Olympic gold\\nmedal. Ironically, Britain's Searle brothers - Jonathan, 23, and Gregory, 20\\n -took the gold medal in that event. They are exactly 10 years younger than\\nthe Abbagnales.\\nAnother, somewhat larger, ensemble we may not see again is American\\nbasketball's Dream Team. US officials are saying that the squad for the next\\nGames may exclude National Basketball Association players. 'Bird', 'Magic'\\nand 'Air' have looked too much like Ugly Americans with their squabbles over\\nsponsorship and status.\\nFinally, Adios] to a few animals. That much-loved horse Murphy Himself has\\nraced his final cross-country event for British rider Ian Stark, who says\\nthat Murphy was the greatest horse he ever rode.\\nFew people have said such kind things about Cobi, the squashy little mascot\\nused to market the Games.

Rewarding, but tiring. \\n\\n\\nJacob, 16, spent last week in Austin, Tex., at the U.S. Swimming Long Course \\nNational Championships. She finished sixth in the 800-meter freestyle and 12th \\nin the 400 freestyle, with personal-best times in both. \\n\\n\\nBut instead of resting on that success, Jacob is improving on it. Thursday, she \\nfinished first in the 200 freestyle at the U.S. Swimming Junior Olympics West \\nat Heritage Park in Irvine. \\n\\n\\nJacob\\'s time of 2:03.41 broke the Junior Olympic West record of 2:03.89, set by \\nCheryl Simmons in 1985. Her time was also less than a second off the national \\njunior record of 2:03.14, held by Yvette Bobling. \\n\\n\\n\"I was really surprised with my time because I\\'m so tired,\" said Jacob, who \\nswims for the Mission Viejo Nadadores. \"I\\'ve been trying to get as much sleep \\nas I can because I was so tired after the Senior Nationals. I wasn\\'t sure if \\nthat would hurt me at this meet. \" \\n\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t. \\n\\n\\nThursday\\'s victory was the second of the meet for Jacob, who won the 100 \\nfreestyle. She trailed Teresa Mauck through most of the race, but managed to \\ntake the lead with 50 meters to go and pulled away. \\n\\n\\nJacob\\'s strength, however, is in the distance events, and she has performed \\nwell enough in those to qualify for the Senior Nationals the past two years. \\n\\n\\nBecause of that, Jacob, who will be a junior at Capistrano Valley High in the \\nfall, cannot compete in any of the distance events at the Junior Olympic meet. \\nUnder U.S. Swimming rules, a swimmer can\\'t compete in the same events in both \\nmeets. \\n\\n\\nJohn Blaney and Robert Fleming also won their second events of the meet \\nThursday. \\n\\n\\nBlaney, who also swims for the Nadadores, held on to win the 400 individual \\nmedley in 4:32.51. He won the 800 freestyle on Tuesday. \\n\\n\\nFleming, a native of Houston, won the 200 freestyle Thursday in 1:53.60. On \\nWednesday, he won the 100 freestyle. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

He has gone from promising young swimmer to \\none with a national reputation, all in the past four months. \\n\\n\\nNow, the next step is close at hand. In a month, Diehl will compete at the \\nGoodwill Games in Seattle. \\n\\n\\nA strong showing there would give him a foothold on the international level. \\n\\n\\n\"Everything has happened so fast, it\\'s kind of caught me by surprise,\" said \\nDiehl, who will be a senior at Mission Viejo High School this fall. \"But I want \\nto compete in the Olympics. That\\'s my long, long term goal. I need to get more \\nexperience against elite swimmers.\" \\n\\n\\nDiehl figures to get plenty of that in the next several weeks. Besides the \\nGoodwill Games, he will swim in the Swim Meet of Champions, which begins \\nThursday at the Marguerite Recreation Center in Mission Viejo. \\n\\n\\nThe meet, which continues through Sunday, will feature several top American \\nswimmers, including Janet Evans, plus members of the East German national team. \\n\\n\\nIt will give Diehl a chance to test how far he\\'s come since winning the \\n1,000-meter freestyle at the U.S. Swimming Short Course National Championships \\nin March. \\n\\n\\n\"I hope to swim fast, but all my focus is on next month,\" Diehl said. \"But this \\nmeet will give me another chance to see where I stand. It will give me an idea \\nof how well I will swim at the Goodwill Games.\" \\n\\n\\nDiehl, who swims for the Mission Viejo Nadadores, will compete in the 800-meter \\nfreestyle in Seattle. He qualified for the games by winning the 1,000 freestyle \\nat the nationals. \\n\\n\\nHis time of 8 minutes 58.26 seconds was a personal best and made him the only \\nswimmer to finish under nine minutes in the event at that meet. \\n\\n\\n\"I was a little surprised by my performance,\" Diehl said. \"I expected to do \\nwell, especially in that event. But I expected the college swimmers to be much \\nfaster. I really thought I was a long shot to win.\" \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s unlikely that Diehl will win Thursday in the 800 freestyle. First, he \\nhasn\\'t tapered his training for the meet. Second, he\\'ll be facing stiff \\ncompetition. \\n\\n\\nArtur Wojdat, who also swims for the Nadadores, and Sebastian Wiese of East \\nGermany also are entered in the event. Wojdat, who competes for the University \\nof Iowa, was a member of Poland\\'s Olympic team in 1988 and Wiese is ranked \\nfifth in the world in the 800 freestyle. \\n\\n\\n\"The meet will be faster this year,\" Diehl said. \"Especially the 800. With \\nArtur alone, it will be faster. But there are a lot more quality swimmers in \\nthat event this year.\" \\n\\n\\nBesides the 800, Diehl also will compete in the 100, 200, 400 and 1,500 \\nfreestyles. It will be his last meet before tapering for the Goodwill Games. \\n\\n\\nBut Diehl\\'s summer of competition will not end in Seattle. After the Goodwill \\nGames, he will go to Austin, Texas, for the U.S. Swimming Long Course Senior \\nNationals, which also will be the qualifying meet for the United States\\' World \\nChampionship team. \\n\\n\\nDiehl will compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles at that meet. \\n\\n\\nAnother strong showing at the nationals could only enhance Diehl\\'s reputation. \\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s see how I do at the Goodwill Games,\" Diehl said. \"Then I\\'ll know how \\nsuccessful my year has been.\" \\n\\n\\nSwim Meet Notes \\n\\n\\nThe only events Thursday will be the men\\'s and women\\'s 800 freestyle. The \\nfinals are scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. . . . A group of 18 East German \\nswimmers will compete, nine men and nine women. Besides Wiese, who also is \\nranked seventh in the world in the 1,500, the team includes Sabina Schulze, who \\nis ranked seventh in the 200 freestyle and 10th in the 100 freestyle, and \\nChristiane Sievert, who is ranked eighth in the 100 butterfly . . . The United \\nStates\\' top two women distance swimmers, Evans and Jane Skillman, will be \\nmatched against each other Thursday in the 800 freestyle. \\n\\n\\nAT A GLANCE \\n\\n\\nWhat: Swim Meet of Champions, featuring several top U.S. swimmers and members \\nof the East German team. \\n\\n\\nWhen: The 800-meter freestyle events are at 4 p.m. Thursday.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJune 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSWIMMING / TRACY DODDS; \\n\\n\\nA BUSY EVANS TO COMPETE IN MEET BEGINNING TODAY \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJanet Evans, who took very little time off after the Olympics in Seoul last \\nSeptember before getting back into her incredible training regimen, somehow \\nmanaged to train, handle a crush of requests for appearances, parades and award \\ndinners and still compete for Placentia\\'s El Dorado High School and her \\nFullerton Aquatics Sports Team, knocking off distance swim records all along \\nthe way. \\n\\n\\nShe\\'s tough over the long haul. \\n\\n\\nToday, just one day after her high school graduation ceremonies, Evans is \\nopening her long-course season in the Swim Meet of Champions at Mission Viejo. \\nEvans will swim the 800 at 4 p.m. and will compete every day in the meet that \\ncontinues through Sunday. \\n\\n\\nEvans also plans to swim the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, \\n200-meter breaststroke, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, \\n400-meter individual medley and the 400-meter freestyle. \\n\\n\\nFinals start at 5 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday. \\n\\n\\nEvans, who will be attending Stanford in the fall and swimming there under the \\ndirection of Richard Quick, former Olympic coach and former women\\'s coach at \\nthe University of Texas, has been working with Don Wagner, the new coach of her \\nFullerton Aquatics team. \\n\\n\\nWagner, a former assistant at the University of Arizona, replaced Bud \\nMcAllister, who coached Evans to three Olympic gold medals before moving on to \\na club in Orlando, Fla. \\n\\n\\nIn January, Evans broke the 1,650-yard freestyle record that had been set by \\nOlympian Tiffany Cohen in 1983. She lowered it from 15 minutes 46.54 seconds to \\n15:44.98. And in March, at the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming Short Course Nationals \\nin Chapel Hill, N.C., she broke Cohen\\'s American record in the 1,000-yard \\nfreestyle. She lowered that record from 9:28.32 to 9:25.49. \\n\\n\\nIt may take her a meet or two to get up to speed in this long-course season, \\nbut Evans is planning to compete in all the major meets. She is one of the \\nstars that U.S. Swimming is planning to use both in Tokyo, at the Pan Pacific \\nmeet, and in Atlanta, against the Soviets, just days later. \\n\\n\\nIf anyone can do it . . . \\n\\n\\nThe annual meet at Mission Viejo has recently acquired Chrysler as a sponsor, \\nwhich could mean that it will again be able to pay travel expenses for the top \\ncaliber swimmers who used to be attracted to the meet when it was sponsored by \\nSeventeen magazine. \\n\\n\\nMost of the swimmers on the West Coast are competing either in the Santa Clara \\nmeet July 7-9 or in the Los Angeles Invitational July 13-16. East Coast \\nswimmers will be competing in the Charlotte Ultra Swim Invitational June 22-25. \\n\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Invitational, which will be held at USC, has drawn not only \\nEvans, but also Olympian Sylvia Poll of Costa Rica. USC Olympians Dave Wharton \\nand Dan Jorgensen are also scheduled to compete. \\n\\n\\nThe L.A. Invitational will be televised by TBS. \\n\\n\\nAll of the early summer meets are tuneups for the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming \\nLong Course National Championships, which also will be held at USC, July \\n31-Aug. 4. \\n\\n\\nMatt Biondi is not ready to say when he plans to race again, but there is \\nlittle doubt that he will. Somehow, somewhere and no doubt for some profit, \\nBiondi will sprint against his old nemesis, Tom Jager. \\n\\n\\nIf Biondi chooses to skip the long-course national meet and, therefore, the Pan \\nPacific meet, it is likely that he will swim a match race with Jager -- a \\nprospect that no doubt would attract network television. \\n\\n\\nBiondi quit the national water polo team last week just before reporting to the \\nBahamas for the filming of a CBS project in which, of course, he swims with the \\ndolphins he has grown to love. \\n\\n\\nBiondi has not raced since his final Olympic event last September. He swam the \\nbutterfly leg for the 400-meter medley relay that won gold, and then announced \\nthat he would be putting all of his athletic efforts into making the national \\nwater polo team. \\n\\n\\nWorking with the water polo team has kept him in shape, and he would certainly \\nbe of value to the U.S. team -- especially on the relays -- if he did decide to \\nqualify for the Pan Pacific meet. As Jeff Dimond of U.S. Swimming put it: \"If \\nMatt decides to swim again, we\\'ll be turning cartwheels.\" \\n\\n\\nPat Hines will defend her title as women\\'s champion in the United States Ten \\nMile Swim in this year\\'s ocean race along a course that runs between Huntington \\nBeach and Seal Beach. Hines is using the race to gain attention for her quest \\nto make an endurance swim an Olympic event. \\n\\n\\nShe would like to see a 10-mile swim become a demonstration event in 1992 and a \\nmedal event by 1996. According to Hines, U.S. Swimming and its masters program \\nhave submitted the event for Olympic consideration. \\n\\n\\n\"Endurance swimming deserves Olympic status,\" she says. \"It is an international \\nsport, it demands the highest levels of skill and training, and it is \\nincredibly exciting.\" \\n\\n\\nSwimming Notes \\n\\n\\nThe United States sent a team of swimmers to the Soviet Union for a meet at \\nTallinn June 2-4 and the young women fared surprisingly well. They won nine \\ngold medals, seven silver and one bronze in the 16 events, including an upset \\ngold in the 400-meter medley relay. Pam Minthorn, 18, of Gaithersburg, Md., who \\nswims for Curl-Burke Swim Club, won the 200-meter freestyle in 2:02.32, the \\n100-meter butterfly in 1:01.5, and the 200-meter butterfly in 2:13.18. Summer \\nSanders, 16, of Roseville, who swims for the California Capital Aquatics, won \\nboth individual medleys. . . . Don Gambril has been named coach of the men\\'s \\nteam and Dick Shoulberg has been named coach of the women\\'s team for the Pan \\nPacific Games, the Alamo Cup and the World Cup meet to be held in Australia in \\nJanuary. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQUANCE MOVES A BIG STEP CLOSER TO FULFILLING OLYMPIC DREAM; \\n\\n\\nSWIMMING: NORTHRIDGE TEEN-AGER\\'S EFFORT IN LONG COURSE CHAMPIONSHIPS LANDED HER \\nON A NATIONAL TEAM THIS SUMMER AND SHOULD EARN HER A BERTH IN THE \\'92 OLYMPIC \\nTRIALS AS WELL. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUntil last week, Kristine Quance\\'s Olympic goal was a secret, something she \\npondered on long, silent swims to avoid being mesmerized by the black line on \\nthe bottom of the pool. \\n\\n\\nBut Quance, 15, from Northridge, let the cat out of the bag last Sunday and \\nMonday at the U. S. Swimming National Long Course Championships in Austin, Tex. \\n\\n\\nAlthough the qualifying times will not be released until the U.S. Swimming \\nconvention Sept. 16-23 in Pittsburgh, Quance\\'s efforts in the 400-meter \\nindividual medley (4 minutes 49.52 seconds) and the 200 breaststroke (2:33.52) \\nare expected to be well under the qualifying standards for the Olympic Trials \\nin March, 1992. \\n\\n\\nIn addition, her third-place finishes in those races put her within striking \\ndistance of the first- or second-place performance she\\'ll need to make the U.S. \\nteam that will travel to Barcelona, Spain, to compete in the Games of the XXVth \\nOlympiad. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s kinda been in the back of my mind, but I\\'ve never told anyone,\" Quance \\nsaid of her Olympic aspirations. \"I still don\\'t want to tell anyone. I don\\'t \\nwant to be bragging about the Olympics, but it\\'s a little more realistic now.\" \\n\\n\\nQuance made it more realistic with a drastic improvement during the past 12 \\nmonths. Her 400 IM time was seven seconds better than her previous best and a \\nwhopping 15 seconds faster than her best time of a year ago. In the 200 \\nbreaststroke, her clocking was three seconds faster than what she swam unshaved \\nand unrested at the Olympic Sports Festival in Minneapolis last month, and \\nseven seconds quicker than her 1989 best. \\n\\n\\n\"At her first nationals last summer at USC we weren\\'t expecting her to make it \\nand she had an awkward time,\" said Steve Reardon, her coach with the Valley \\nAquatic Swim Team. \\n\\n\\n\"In the second one in Nashville last March she did her best times in the \\nmorning (preliminaries) but she didn\\'t come back (well) at night (in the \\nfinals). It was a sign that she was too excited by her morning swims. \\n\\n\\n\"But here, she had great races in the morning and she came back and made some \\nadjustments and swam even better times at night. She feels like she belongs at \\nthis level now.\" \\n\\n\\nAlready Quance has earned a berth at yet another level. This weekend, she will \\nmake her international debut in the Legion of European Nations Cup in Rome. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m pretty excited about going to Italy,\" Quance said. \"I\\'ve never been \\nanywhere with U.S. Swimming except Canada and Minneapolis. \\n\\n\\n\"I like traveling with swimming, I really don\\'t have a problem getting \\nhomesick. It\\'s really exciting, but it can get tiring because of the pressure.\" \\n\\n\\nNot to mention the intimidation. Quance is still in awe of Olympian Janet Evans \\nas well as Summer Sanders and Mary Ellen Blanchard, among others. But the \\ndifference between her first national championship meet last summer and her \\nlast is that now she can race with the best in the U.S. in the individual \\nmedley and the breaststroke. \\n\\n\\n\"I kinda still do idolize them because they are so awesome, and when I first \\nstarted going to nationals they were so much more awesome, \" Quance said. \"But \\nnow I\\'m getting closer and closer. I didn\\'t really expect to place here and it \\nstill hasn\\'t sunk in.\" \\n\\n\\nWhile Quance\\'s inexperience was painfully obvious in the 200 breaststroke, her \\ntalent was equally apparent. She reached the first wall ahead of the field, \\nestablished a personal best at the 100 by turning in 1:13.00 and maintained the \\nlead through 150 meters. \\n\\n\\nAt that point, the more experienced Blanchard (granddaughter of Heisman trophy \\nwinner Doc Blanchard) and Jill Johnson passed her and Quance held on for third. \\n\\n\\nIn the individual medley, she picked up time on all four strokes, but still \\nsuffers from a weak backstroke leg. \\n\\n\\n\"Her backstroke is something we\\'ve worked on from Nashville (last March) until \\nnow,\" Reardon said. \"It has helped her cause. She still falls behind the \\nleaders, but in Nashville, she fell behind the whole field.\" \\n\\n\\nOn her best leg, the breaststroke, Quance makes up for lost time, but that \\ntakes its toll on the final freestyle portion. \\n\\n\\n\"It takes her 25 meters to recover because she goes so hard on the \\nbreaststroke,\" Reardon said. \"But all those things will work out. I guarantee \\nher next nationals she\\'ll be more competitive on the backstroke and the \\nfreestyle. \\n\\n\\n\"Now she has a taste of what it\\'s like to be in a race like that.\" \\n\\n\\nAccording to Ed Spencer, coach of the Industry Hills Aquatic Club, it\\'s that \\nability to race that sets her apart. \\n\\n\\n\"Sometimes athletes only do about two-thirds of what they need to do,\" Spencer \\nsaid. \"Some of them work hard in the pool, but up on the blocks they are not at \\nall cut out for the perfect race. \\n\\n\\n\"Others are great racers, but they are not willing to pay the price in \\nworkouts. Kristine is going all out in workouts and weight training on her own, \\nand when she gets up on the blocks, she\\'s all business.\" \\n\\n\\nThough Quance, who began swimming at age 10, has reached the age when \\nboy-watching and shopping with friends compete with the early hours, cold \\ntemperatures and monotony of her sensory-deprivation sport, Reardon believes \\nshe can withstand distractions. \\n\\n\\nFor now. \\n\\n\\n\"She hasn\\'t been swimming that long so everything is really fresh and new to \\nher,\" he said. \"And she\\'s having too much fun doing what she\\'s doing, \\nespecially coming to a meet like this and getting third. \\n\\n\\n\"After Nashville, she said she didn\\'t want fifth and sixth any more, and now \\nshe doesn\\'t want third. She\\'s constantly upgrading her goals.\" \\n\\n\\nEven at the risk, it appears, of someone finding out.Associated Press \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSINK OR SWIM; \\n\\n\\nPURSLEY IS THRUST INTO ROLE OF OVERSEEING REVIVAL OF U.S. AQUATICS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the bleakest night of an overall less-than-stellar Olympic swimming effort \\nin Seoul last fall, Richard Quick, the U.S. coach at the time, sat at the side \\nof the warm-up pool and enumerated, one more time for the record, what he \\nthought was needed to get the United States back into a position of dominance \\nin international waters. Among his suggestions was a recommendation for a \\nfull-time, long-term national coach. \\n\\n\\nIn March, Dennis Pursley became U.S. Swimming\\'s national team director. \\n\\n\\nHe\\'s not exactly a coach. That is, he doesn\\'t stand on the deck with a \\nstopwatch and he doesn\\'t instruct any swimmer on how to swim. But he\\'s not \\nexactly a stick-to-the-office bureaucrat, either. \\n\\n\\nPursley comes from the coaching ranks and he believes that a big part of his \\njob is to keep in constant contact with the coaches, to know what the needs \\nare, and to help the coaches get the swimmers ready to win in the next Olympic \\nGames. \\n\\n\\n\"Absolutely, I see my job as doing everything I can to get the best team \\npossible to Barcelona,\" Pursley said. \"I\\'m looking at each meet, each event, as \\na step toward Barcelona.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd having a national director means that there is an office in Colorado \\nSprings that serves as a clearing house of information and ideas, that keeps \\nall those steps in sync. \"There is continuity, and a long-range view,\" Pursley \\nsaid. \"We don\\'t have a new group coming in every year or every few years to \\nre-invent the wheel.\" \\n\\n\\nOf course there will still be a range of opinions. Not all of the coaches and \\nswimmers and parents are going to agree on what steps are the best steps. For \\nthat matter, there were plenty of coaches who didn\\'t think there was a need for \\na national director. \\n\\n\\n\"The key to success is the cooperation of the coaches,\" Pursley said. \"I was \\nvery apprehensive about accepting the position because I wasn\\'t sure what the \\nlevel of cooperation would be. But in the first few months, I couldn\\'t be more \\npleased. Even the coaches who are doubtful that this is the way we should go \\nare being cooperative. \\n\\n\\n\"That cooperative attitude is what is going to help U.S. Swimming regain the \\ndominance we once enjoyed.\" \\n\\n\\nAt the Olympic International Operations Committee meeting in April in Colorado \\nSprings, Pursley was given approval for his first four-year plan. \\n\\n\\nNot all of his objectives can be simply acted upon. Some are long-range goals. \\nBut at least there is a direction. \\n\\n\\nAmong Pursley\\'s goals: \\n\\n\\n -- Changing the scheduling of the Olympic trials. In 1992, the trials will be \\nheld a full five months before the Games, giving the swimmers time to recover \\nfrom the very competitive qualifying meet and prepare for the Olympics as their \\nindividual coaches choose. \\n\\n\\n -- Planning some training camps in Barcelona. \\n\\n\\n -- Rethinking the national meet schedule to put the focus on what is best for \\nthe United States as a national team. A swimmer\\'s competitions should build \\ntoward a best performance in international competition and Olympic competition. \\nMeets should not divert attention and energies. \\n\\n\\n -- Establishing a system of rankings that would allow swimmers to make the \\nnational team and be automatically qualified for more than one international \\ncompetition. That is, to eliminate the pressure on swimmers to peak for \\nqualifying meets and give U.S. Swimming the opportunity to include in \\ninternational competition swimmers who are likely to win medals. \\n\\n\\n -- Eliminating some of the scheduling conflicts between U.S. Swimming and the \\nNational Collegiate Athletic Assn. \\n\\n\\n -- Convincing the NCAA that a short-course program (yards) is at odds with the \\ndevelopment of swimmers who must compete internationally long course (meters). \\n\\n\\n -- Developing better financial support for postgraduate swimmers in order to \\nkeep elite athletes swimming for the U.S. \\n\\n\\n -- Promoting the concept of the U.S. team, not just in the few weeks around \\nthe international competitions, but at all times. \\n\\n\\nNo new notions at all. But until now, no one has been employed full time to \\nbringing the coaches together to get these goals accomplished. \\n\\n\\n\"My job has been likened to a general manager position,\" Pursley said. \"I can \\nfree up the coaches to coach, unencumbered by administrative responsibilities. \\nAt the same time, I can bring some continuity to our teams. It\\'s not an \\nentirely new staff every few years.\" \\n\\n\\nThe national coaches now are elected to serve for about a year. Currently the \\nU.S. team coaches are Don Gambril of the University of Alabama for the men and \\nDick Shoulberg of Team Foxcatcher for the women. \\n\\n\\nU.S. Swimming has been evolving toward this arrangement for several years. \\n\\n\\nGambril was the first Olympic coach who was asked to serve a longer term, and \\nhe served as national coach in 1983 and 1984. \\n\\n\\nThen, in 1985, U.S. Swimming decided that a national head coach should serve \\nfour years, to develop the Olympic team. Quick was named to that position from \\n1985 through the Olympics in the fall of 1989. But Quick, then the women\\'s \\ncoach at the University of Texas, didn\\'t have the position long before he was \\nsaying that the national coach should devote more time to the effort that \\nanyone could devote while at the same time devoting full time to his own \\nswimmers. \\n\\n\\nThe person in charge of directing the effort needed to have a background as a \\ncoach in order to understand the needs of the swimmers and the positions of the \\ncoaches. \\n\\n\\nPursley has coached seven different teams, including the Lakeside (Ky.) Swim \\nClub, the Cincinnati Pepsi Marlins, the Olympian Swim Club in Edmonton and the \\nnew Phoenician Swim team in Phoenix. Among the swimmers he has coached is Mary \\nT. Meagher. \\n\\n\\nPursley also served as the national team director in Australia. \\n\\n\\nPursley makes it clear that among his first orders of business is figuring out \\njust what his job is and what he can reasonably expect to accomplish. \\n\\n\\n\"Prior to the time the position was created, all policy and structure was \\ndetermined by a very large committee, 40 or 50 people on the Olympic \\nInternational Operations Committee,\" Pursley said. \"It was mostly prominent \\ncoaches and about 20% athletes. The committee met twice yearly for up to 15 \\nhours in a day. . . \\n\\n\\n\"There was a growing frustration because this committee wasn\\'t able to \\naccomplish what it wanted to accomplish. They felt we needed someone doing it \\nday in and day out to establish continuity . . . That committee is still \\nimportant. I am here to try to carry out the goals of the committee.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd to serve as a liaison between the coaches and the committee. Which, \\nbasically, makes him a liaison between coaches and coaches. \\n\\n\\n\"I feel that my responsibility is to work for the coaches and with the coaches, \\nto keep my ear to the ground and determine, from the coaches\\' point of view, \\nwhat needs to be done and what direction we want to go,\" he said. \\n\\n\\n\"When there is a consensus of opinion, I will act to implement a program. When \\nthere is not a consensus of opinion, that\\'s when we need a national director to \\nmake a decision. . . \\n\\n\\n\"But everything I do, I do with the input of the coaches. I\\'ve been pleased \\nwith the amount of input I\\'ve received, and I hope to get even more letters and \\nphone calls. The phone lines are open.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 26, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAGING MARK SPITZ EYES RENEWED OLYMPIC GLORY \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe afternoon sun no longer covered Lane 8 of the UCLA pool when Mark Spitz, \\nthree days past 40, jumped in to swim. It was cold and dark in his column of \\nwater, not a particularly good day for swimming, or dreaming. \\n\\n\\nSpitz put in 40 minutes, which is a fine workout for a man nearing middle age, \\nbut a little on the light side for a future Olympian. Then he laid his head \\nback as if the water were his pillow, slowly closed his eyes and puffed out his \\ncheeks. Moments later, his eyes blinked open to see two people standing on the \\ndeck, peering down at him. \\n\\n\\n\"My arms,\" he said, \"feel like lead.\" \\n\\n\\nHe puttered around another moment or two, then made up his mind that the 1992 \\nSummer Olympics were far enough away that on this day in February 1990, he \\ncould afford to get out of the water. \"Well, I\\'ve got 862 days left,\" he said, \\nfinally managing a smile, and the workout was over. \\n\\n\\nComing back to the water after 17 years on land is not easy, Mark Spitz is \\nlearning. \\n\\n\\nLast summer Spitz -- America\\'s most famous swimmer and the not-altogether \\nbeloved winner of seven gold medals at the 1972 Munich Olympics -- decided he \\nwanted to become a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team in Barcelona. Last \\nSeptember word got out, and a giddy sense of anticipation enveloped the \\nswimming world. Spitz swam for an hour; granted an interview for an hour. Swam \\nanother hour, granted another interview. And so forth. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s been a heady time, but it\\'s also sobering. Spitz injured his chronically \\nbad back, spent several weeks recuperating at home and about six weeks out of \\nthe water. \"Too much too soon,\" he said. As he talked, his hands tried to coax \\nthe pain out of his left hamstring. He isn\\'t even attempting to swim his chosen \\nOlympic stroke, the butterfly, for a few more weeks. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s all such a chore that, with a chuckle, he said the most difficult part is \\nleaving himself enough energy for the 10-minute walk home, through the UCLA \\ncampus to his single-level, four-bedroom brick home in plush Holmby Hills. \\n\\n\\nAnd yet Spitz is undaunted. He said he most definitely will get back into shape \\nafter doing little more than walking the dog and sailing for the better part of \\ntwo decades; he believes he can swim as fast as he did in 1972, when he set the \\nworld record in the 100-meter butterfly (as well as three other individual \\nevents); he believes he can make an Olympic team full of swimmers half his age; \\nand he is not going to give up, come what may. \\n\\n\\n\"I want this,\" he said in an interview before a recent practice. \"As a kid, I \\nended up in the sport of swimming through osmosis. I went out, sort of swam, \\nwas on a team, I got better, I got good, I got great, then I held world \\nrecords. I never had a chance to sit back and reflect: What would I be doing if \\nI wasn\\'t doing this? \\n\\n\\n\"Now, I\\'ve elected to actually do it. There\\'s a difference. When you want to do \\nsomething, you want it more. Not that I didn\\'t want it then. But now I want it \\neven more.\" \\n\\n\\nWhen he announced his intention to make the Olympic team at age 42, the \\npictures that went with all the stories showed a bronzed, sculpted Spitz, \\njet-black hair slicked back by the water, a man unchanged by time (except for \\nthe mustache, which is long gone). In reality, there\\'s gray in that black hair, \\nquite a bit of it. \\n\\n\\nFor a 40-year-old, Spitz is in wonderful shape and still possesses the great \\nswimmer\\'s body, arms that go on forever attached to a torso so long his head \\nhits the roof when he sits in the car, making it appear he is 6 feet 4, not a \\ngenerous 6-1. \\n\\n\\nBut when he walks out of the locker room in his swimming suit, after all the \\nUCLA swimmers have passed by, it\\'s evident time takes its toll on everybody. \\n\\n\\n\"He looks a little thick, doesn\\'t he?\" said Mark Wallace, one of Spitz\\'s best \\nfriends from their Indiana University days, who was sitting by the pool. \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'ll move that weight around,\" said UCLA swimming coach Ron Ballatore, who \\nhas mixed Spitz into his practices and is one of the truest believers in the \\nSpitz camp. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not toned,\" said Spitz, who weighs 185 pounds, 10 more than in Munich. \"In \\nsix months I will be.\" \\n\\n\\nThe fact that Spitz is more like one of us now than he was when he was 22 makes \\nhis \"quest,\" to use his word, all the more enchanting. He isn\\'t an untouchable \\ngod; he used to be, but not anymore. Now he\\'s a husband and the father of an \\n8-year-old boy who\\'d rather play baseball than swim. \\n\\n\\nSpitz runs his own real-estate-development business and never became a dentist, \\ndespite what people remember. He walks the UCLA campus in baggy sweats, \\nslouched over, as is his way, and no one pays attention to him. \\n\\n\\n\"I owe it to myself, I owe it to my sport, I owe it to my generation, I think, \\nto find out what it\\'s all about,\" Spitz said. \"I really preserved myself. I was \\nMr. Joe Straight Arrow. I don\\'t drink, I don\\'t smoke, I don\\'t do drugs. What \\ndoes it take to get a body back in shape? We\\'ll all find out.\" \\n\\n\\nBut Spitz is coming back for reasons more profound than this. If he simply \\nwanted to find out how fast he could swim, for swimming\\'s sake, he would join a \\nmasters club and compete against men his age. Although he\\'s not doing that, it \\nwas a friend in masters swimming that gave him the idea to try for one more \\nOlympics. \\n\\n\\nLast spring Spitz ran into Lance Larson, a member of the 1960 Olympic team who \\nis swimming masters and going faster than he did 30 years ago. He suggested \\nSpitz could do that, too. \\n\\n\\n\"That\\'s ridiculous,\" Spitz said. \\n\\n\\nWallace, meanwhile, was taking another tack. With Spitz\\'s 1972 times firmly in \\nmind, he loved to calculate where his buddy would have placed had he swum that \\ntime in a certain event. Just last spring, at the NCAA championships, he looked \\nat the scoreboard after the 100 butterfly, turned toward a woman in the stands \\nand held up an open hand. \"Fifth,\" he thought. \\n\\n\\nThe woman nodded and smiled back. She was Marge Counsilman, wife of Spitz\\'s \\ncoach at Indiana, the legendary Doc Counsilman. \\n\\n\\n\"Think about that,\" Wallace said. \"His world record would have been good for \\nfifth place 17 years later.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd that, eventually, was what got to Spitz. He set a world record in Munich \\nwith a time of 54.27 seconds in the 100 butterfly. The current world record is \\n52.84, set by Pablo Morales of the United States. All of Spitz\\'s other world \\nrecords have been lowered by three or five seconds. But not this one. His \\nbutterfly time would have placed eighth at the 1988 Olympics. \\n\\n\\nSpitz started to wonder if he might not be able to swim that time again -- or \\ngo even faster, as those in masters swimming were doing. He would have to train \\nfor one event -- not seven, as he did in 1972. He could test new coaching \\ntechniques with new coaches. He could regain his eligibility because of new \\nrules allowing professionalism in swimming. He could try to do the impossible. \\n\\n\\n\"The only reason I\\'m in this is because of what swimmers in the 100 butterfly \\ndidn\\'t do in the last 17 to 18 years,\" he said. \"They didn\\'t improve my time by \\nthat much.\" \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s also interesting to note Spitz\\'s 54.27 might not have been the best he \\ncould have swum in the late summer of 1972. For one, he was involved in \"all \\nthose damn events\" and was conserving energy any time he got ahead in a race. \\nHe also was not pushed in the 100 fly in Munich; Bruce Robertson of Canada won \\nthe silver in 55.56. That\\'s a significant difference in swimming. \\n\\n\\n\"If I just do my same time, it\\'s competitive,\" he said. \"If I improve my time, \\nwe\\'re talking about possibly breaking the world record. I\\'ve got nothing to \\nlose. I\\'ll go in three stages: get into shape as a 22-year-old, which I\\'ll do \\nin the next six months; go fast enough to make the Olympic team in the trials \\nin 1992; and then go to the Olympics and see what I get.\" \\n\\n\\nTo ask a question is to burst the bubble, but an observer must do it: \\n\\n\\n\"How do you get back into the shape of a 22-year-old when you\\'re 40?\" \\n\\n\\nSpitz: \"I\\'m asking myself that same question. But there are guys who are 50 who \\nare swimming faster than when they were 20. Their times are slower than mine, \\nbut the analogy still works.\" \\n\\n\\nAnother question: \"But didn\\'t they have more to improve upon than you, who was \\nin peak condition at 22?\" \\n\\n\\n\"Yes, that\\'s true,\" Spitz said. \"Maybe that\\'s a factor. I don\\'t know. . . . The \\nsafe thing to say is I won\\'t make it. That\\'s more logical.\" \\n\\n\\nSpitz would prefer not to think of all this, at least not now. \\n\\n\\n\"I have one great ray of hope. In 1988, Pablo was the world-record holder and \\nPablo didn\\'t make the Olympic team. They didn\\'t break his world record, either. \\nI was the world-record holder in 1968 and I lost (by finishing second). I don\\'t \\nhave to be the best before the Olympics to get to the Olympics.\" \\n\\n\\nThe path to the Olympics begins sometime late this summer, when Spitz said he \\nwill compete in his first race. It probably will not be part of a conventional \\nmeet. At least two TV networks have expressed interest in being there when he \\nfirst steps onto the blocks, and it\\'s likely the event will be built around \\nSpitz. \\n\\n\\nUntil then, he is swimming simply to prepare. After a morning of business \\ncalls, Spitz makes his 10-minute walk from home to pool for his 3:30 p.m. \\nworkout with the UCLA team. Although Ballatore is more engrossed with his dozen \\ncollegians, he keeps a watchful eye on Spitz, who is working himself back into \\nshape after the injury by swimming 2,000 to 3,000 yards a day, six days a week. \\n\\n\\n\"He needs to get up to 6,000, and he will,\" Ballatore said. \\n\\n\\nEven so, Spitz will not swim as many miles for this Olympics as others might \\nbecause he will be so focused on the butterfly. Interestingly, although the \\nbutterfly is his stroke, Spitz will swim mostly freestyle until the day of his \\nfirst race closes in. \\n\\n\\n\"He never did a lot of fly anyway,\" Ballatore said. \\n\\n\\nEarlier in the day Ballatore spoke over the phone with George Haines, who \\ncoached Spitz when he was a teenager. \\n\\n\\n\"I think he can do it,\" Haines said to Ballatore. \"Tell me, how does his \\nfreestyle look?\" \\n\\n\\n\"It looks great,\" Ballatore said. \\n\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" Haines replied, \"it always looked great.\" \\n\\n\\nTo make the team that heads to Barcelona, Spitz will have to finish either \\nfirst or second in the 100 fly at the trials in March 1992. To get to the \\ntrials, he will have to swim a qualifying time sometime the year before. In \\n1988, the qualifying time was 55.79 seconds, but it will be lower this time. \\n\\n\\nMatt Biondi won the \\'88 trials in 53.09 and took the silver medal in Seoul in \\n53.01 seconds, 1-100th of a second behind gold medalist Anthony Nesty of \\nSurinam. Biondi had the gold medal in his grasp until he miscalculated the \\nnumber of strokes it would take to hit the wall; he glided in, and Nesty won \\nwhen Biondi\\'s last stroke did not carry him to the finish. \\n\\n\\n\"If that had been Mark, there\\'s no way he would have lost that race,\" said \\nWallace. \"He\\'s too competitive.\" \\n\\n\\nIf Spitz qualifies, he will face about 40 swimmers for those two spots on the \\nOlympic team. Making the team would put him one qualifying heat from the \\neight-man final in Barcelona. The final would put him within a minute of the \\nmost improbable personal story in Olympic history. \\n\\n\\nSpitz already has a bank vault full of gold medals, nine in all (seven from \\nMunich, two from relays during his disappointing performance at the 1968 Mexico \\nCity Games). But he is coming back to earn something worth more than gold to \\nhim: the respect and perhaps even the love of Americans who never understood or \\nreally cared for him the last time he came around. \\n\\n\\nArrogance is a part of the swimming \"psych,\" the look, the airs, that tell \\nanother swimmer you are about to beat them. Spitz was great at walking around \\nthe pool as if he owned the place, and he just about did. Asked if he thought \\nhe was going to hit it rich after Munich (and he did), his answer, typically, \\nwas something like, \"Are there stars in the sky?\" \\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s definitely mellowed,\" said Wallace. \"He\\'s not as sarcastic as he was. He \\nwas very inward-focused then. He really didn\\'t care what he said or what others \\nsaid about him. All that mattered to him was what he did in the water.\" \\n\\n\\nThose were strange, terrible times. Soon after his last race in Munich, Spitz, \\nwho is Jewish, was whisked out of town when terrorists took 11 Israeli athletes \\nand coaches hostage and later killed them all. Spitz was safe, but he was \\ncaught in a whirlwind of emotions that deposited him in a world of endorsements \\nand total isolation. \\n\\n\\n\"I was 22, the press was different, athletics was different,\" he said. \"I \\nstarted making money from an amateur sport. There was a little queasiness and \\nuneasy feeling about the fact that I was doing it. \\n\\n\\n\"I was on the scene for 14 years, but the public all of a sudden became aware \\nof me in a one-week period of time, and then I was gone. I wasn\\'t out to make \\nanother touchdown pass like Joe Montana or another Super Bowl championship or \\nwhatever. \\n\\n\\n\"Now, it\\'s not that I want to bask in the glory that I think I was denied, but \\nthe fact is, I\\'m trying to do something that for me is an interesting and \\nexciting challenge. It sort of represents the ideals of the Olympics: It\\'s the \\nspirit of competing, the attempt.\" \\n\\n\\nSwimming people are intrigued. \\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s got a lot going against him,\" said Biondi, winner of five golds, one \\nsilver and one bronze in Seoul. \"Age, his time out of swimming and the \\ntremendous amount of motivation needed to smash people like a bug. There are \\nplenty of obstacles, but he definitely has a chance.\" \\n\\n\\n\"If anyone can do it,\" said Ballatore, \"he\\'s the kind of guy who can.\" \\n\\n\\nBut can anyone do it? \\n\\n\\n\"My days are numbered,\" Spitz said. \"I\\'ve got 26 months before the Olympic \\ntrials. Twenty-six months may seem like a lot to a guy who\\'s 20, but to a guy \\nwho\\'s now 40, that seems like it\\'s 26 days. Some days I get frustrated with \\nmyself. Other days, I feel great. \\n\\n\\n\"But, what the heck.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSWIMMING / TRACY DODDS; \\n\\n\\nEVANS, BIONDI IN RUNNING FOR SULLIVAN AWARD \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJanet Evans and Matt Biondi, the Southern California swimmers who starred in \\nthe Olympics at Seoul, are among 10 finalists for the Sullivan Award, given \\neach year to the outstanding amateur athlete in the country. \\n\\n\\nSwimming was the only sport with two finalists when the list was cut down from \\n46 by the Amateur Athletic Union\\'s selection committee. \\n\\n\\nThe winner will be announced March 6 in Indianapolis. \\n\\n\\nEvans, who took only a brief break from swimming after the Olympics, is back \\ncompeting for Placentia\\'s El Dorado High School. On Jan. 16 at Long Beach, she \\nset a U.S. record in the 1,650-yard freestyle at 15 minutes 44.98 seconds, \\ntaking more than a second and a half off the nearly 6-year-old record set by \\nTiffany Cohen, 15:46.54. \\n\\n\\nLook for more American records to fall now that Evans will be swimming some \\nmajor meets in yards, distances unique to the United States. \\n\\n\\nSince Evans broke her first world record in July, 1987, the major meets have \\nbeen long course (meters) in preparation for the \\'88 Olympic Games. But the \\nU.S. swimmers will be competing in yards in some major meets, including the \\nPhillips 66-U.S. Swimming Short Course Nationals at Chapel Hill, N.C., March \\n21-25. \\n\\n\\nAt that meet, Evans is expected to swim the 400-yard individual medley, the \\n500-yard freestyle, the 200-yard individual medley and the 1,000-yard \\nfreestyle. \\n\\n\\nWith the 1,650 record already in hand, she will skip that event in North \\nCarolina. \\n\\n\\nBiondi isn\\'t doing any competitive swimming these days, but he has been staying \\nin shape to be ready for the tryouts for the U.S. water polo team, to be held \\nat Newport Beach Feb. 4 and 5. \\n\\n\\nSince most of the water polo team retired after the 1988 Games, Coach Bill \\nBarnett has a lot of spaces to fill. \\n\\n\\nBesides doing speaking engagements and some commercial appearances, Biondi was \\nback in the waters off the coast of Florida, swimming with dolphins for an \\nABC-TV special with Curt Gowdy that shows an apparent special communication \\nbetween dolphins and children with Down\\'s syndrome. ABC will televise the \\nspecial April 2. \\n\\n\\nBiondi also has been kept pretty busy accepting awards and still has a few more \\nto pick up. \\n\\n\\nBiondi already has been named United Press International\\'s sportsman of the \\nyear and the United States Olympic Committee\\'s sportsman of the year. Not to \\nmention being named Italian-American man of the year. \\n\\n\\nIncluded in a long list of appointments is his Feb. 3 date at Boca Raton, Fla., \\nfor a basketball slam dunk contest against the likes of Carl Lewis. \\n\\n\\nAlthough he is staying busy, Biondi isn\\'t cashing in on his 7 medals. When he \\npassed through New York last month on a tour of 12 cities in 8 days, Biondi \\ntold John Nelson of the Associated Press that he was in the wrong sport for \\nmaking big bucks. And, he said, 1988 wasn\\'t the best Olympic year for cashing \\nin, either. \\n\\n\\n\"No one is going to get rich from these Olympics except maybe Flo Jo, if she \\nplays it right,\" Biondi said, referring to track star Florence Griffith Joyner. \\n\\n\\n\"There were so many controversies -- steroids, television, the boxing -- and \\nthen there was the time difference. I think people got kind of turned off. \\nAdvertisers realize that. \\n\\n\\n\"I heard one advertiser\\'s quote. He said, \\'Our company would rather sponsor \\nevents than athletes, because events don\\'t do drugs or beat their wives.\\' It\\'s \\ngetting harder for the athlete instead of easier.\" \\n\\n\\nExplaining why swimming isn\\'t as potentially lucrative as other Olympic sports \\nsuch as boxing or figure skating, and why swimmers don\\'t draw top endorsements, \\nBiondi said: \"The Olympics is only once every 4 years, and for that magical \\nweek, everybody is watching and reading about it. But to stay on top, you have \\nto be heard from a little more often than that.\" \\n\\n\\nUSC and UCLA are undefeated in swimming this season. USC is 6-0 and already has \\n10 swimmers qualified for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. meet. That\\'s \\nthe most the Trojans have ever qualified before the Pac-10 meet. \\n\\n\\nHelping build that total are the 1988 Olympians on the USC team, who missed the \\nfirst semester because of the trip to Seoul but are allowed to use Olympic \\ntimes for qualifying times. \\n\\n\\nThe Trojans are competing this weekend in the Dallas Classic at Southern \\nMethodist, swimming against SMU, Texas, Stanford, California and Michigan. \\n\\n\\nThe Bruins (7-0) already have Mark Dean qualified for the NCAA meet. Dean \\nqualified for the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:47.25 in a meet against \\nArizona State Jan. 13. \\n\\n\\nAlso on the Bruin team is breaststroker Andrea Cecci, who was the Italian \\nnational champion in the 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke. \\n\\n\\nThe Trojans and the Bruins are both 2-0 in the Pac-10. They will not meet until \\nFeb. 25. \\n\\n\\nThe USC women\\'s swim team is 5-4 and has four women qualified for the NCAA \\nmeet. Leslie Daland and Kathy Hettche have qualified in the 1,650 -- Daland at \\n16:33.63 and Hettche at 16:37.93 -- as well as Leslie Seward in the 200-yard \\nbreaststroke and Terri O\\'Loughlin in the 100-yard butterfly. \\n\\n\\nThe UCLA women are 8-1 after a big victory at Cal last weekend. The Bruin women \\nhave lost only to Stanford, which is as strong as usual. \\n\\n\\nU.S. Swimming, in keeping with its philosophy of getting international \\nexperience for a wide range of swimmers, is sending a team of 6 to the \\nCoca-Cola International Meet at Paris Feb. 3-5 and the Meetings Arena at Bonn, \\nWest Germany, Feb. 10-12. \\n\\n\\nOn the team will be Steve Crocker of St. Louis, Matt Rankin of the Click Tucson \\nteam, Beth Barr of the Greater Pensacola Swim Team, Whitney Hedgepeth of the \\nVirginia Assn. for Competitive Aquatics, Ann Mahoney of the Wichita Swim Club \\nand Jenny Thompson of the Seacost Swim Team. Jay Fitzgerald of the Santa Clara \\nSwim Club is going as the coach. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nMay 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBELL SWIMMER TRIMS TIME IN HOPE OF SPOT ON U.S. TEAM \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an atmosphere of chlorine and liniment so familiar to her, Helen Salcedo, \\nafreshman at Bell High School and a top national swimmer, waited to compete in \\nthe CIF City Section meet at Belmont Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach. \\n\\n\\nOut of the turquoise water, Salcedo blended in with the other swimmers, who, \\nwrapped in sweat suits or towels, socialized on the bleachers or by the snack \\nstand. \\n\\n\\nBefore taking practice laps for the 100-yard breast stroke event last week, the \\n14-year-old talked about what she likes most about her sport. \\n\\n\\n\"Finishing a race and knowing you did your best,\" she said. \"When everybody in \\nthe building is clapping, the feeling sends shivers up and down your spine.\" \\n\\n\\nSalcedo, who won her first meet when she was 6, has impressive credentials. In \\nMarch she won the 200-yard breast stroke at the Junior Nationals in Iowa City \\nwith a time of 2:20.96, only 11 seconds slower than the national senior women\\'s \\nrecord. \\n\\n\\nShe has been lowering her times dramatically. Two winters ago, she swam the \\n200-yard breast stroke in over three minutes. But last summer at the Junior \\nNationals in Austin, Tex., she swam the long-course 200-meter breast stroke in \\n2:48.99. Although she did not place, the time was a personal best. \\n\\n\\nShe hopes to make the National Junior Team, a 12-boy, 12-girl group that will \\ntrain in the fall at Colorado Springs and compete next January in Europe. That, \\nsaid Don Watkinds, her coach at the Bellflower Aquatic Club, requires a \\n200-meter breast stroke time of about 2:38. \\n\\n\\n\"If she would jump in the pool now and swim 200 meters under 2:38 it wouldn\\'t \\nsurprise me,\" Watkinds said. \\n\\n\\nSalcedo, who learned to swim at the South Gate YMCA, was a unique addition to \\nthe Bell High team: the first girl to come in with experience, according to \\nBell Coach Frosty Golembeske. \\n\\n\\n\"Most of the kids don\\'t know how to swim at all when they get here, or maybe \\njust a survival stroke,\" said Golembeske, who coaches in an area not known for \\nits number of back-yard pools. \\n\\n\\nGolembeske wore a T-shirt that proclaimed Bell the \"Team of the Decade.\" \\n\\n\\nIn the last nine years, Golembeske\\'s teams have not lost a meet in the \\nNortheastern League, which also consists of South Gate, Huntington Park, \\nGarfield, Roosevelt and Eagle Rock high schools. He admitted, though, that the \\nBell Eagles were not in the class of perennial power Palisades High. (Palisades \\nwon the CIF meet and Bell finished fourth.) \\n\\n\\n\"We just put a lot of time and work in it, and try to stay on top of the new \\ntechniques,\" he said. \"And a lot of it stems from desire and tradition.\" \\n\\n\\nSalcedo, who did not lose an event this season, said she was apprehensive when \\nshe joined the Bell team. \"At first I was nervous because I thought they would \\nthink, \\'This girl is much better than we are,\\' and wouldn\\'t accept me. But they \\nwere friendly.\" \\n\\n\\n\"They realized that she\\'s there to help us,\" said Golembeske, who believes that \\nSalcedo will be an All-American this year. \"She works hard and has a good \\nattitude.\" \\n\\n\\nWhy is Salcedo, who also does well in freestyle and butterfly events, most \\nproficient at the breast stroke? \\n\\n\\n\"The strongest part of the stroke is the kick, and I have strong legs,\" she \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\nWatkinds said, \"It has a lot to do with ankle and knee flexibility, and the \\npower they can generate.\" \\n\\n\\nShe practices from 4 to 7 p.m. five days a week, but not with her teammates in \\nthe Bell pool. She and her brother, Tommy, a Bell High junior, go to the \\nBellflower Aquatic Club in Thompson Park for more advanced training under \\nWatkinds. \\n\\n\\nThe club swimmers first work on weight machines and do sit-ups and pull-ups, \\nthen endure intense sessions in the water. \\n\\n\\nWhen not swimming or doing homework, Salcedo says she enjoys listening to \\n\"mellow\" rock music. \\n\\n\\n\"She just listens to her radio in her room or helps mom around the house,\" \\nTommy said. \\n\\n\\nWearing a purple cap, Salcedo lay on her stomach on a table beneath the \\nbleachers a few minutes before the 100-meter breast stroke finals. Watkinds \\nvigorously kneaded and twisted her ankles, and stretched her muscular legs. \\n\\n\\n\"I make sure she\\'s loose,\" he said. \"And this increases her circulation.\" \\n\\n\\nThen the two went through a visualization of the race. He leaned over, close to \\nher ear, and said, \"You\\'re driving forward . . . snap those legs . . . you\\'re \\nmaking your move . . . accelerate!\" \\n\\n\\nHe checked his stopwatch and went on: \"You\\'re driving into the wall . . . hit \\nthe wall right . . . you\\'re hitting the wall . . . now, everything you\\'ve got.\" \\n\\n\\nHe then applied a light green cream that he said was a mixture of mineral oil, \\nwintergreen, alcohol, lanolin and witch hazel. \"She likes it hot,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nThen a goggled Salcedo took her mark and the race began. \\n\\n\\n\"Come on, Helen. Let\\'s go, Helen,\" shouted her teammates, standing on the deck. \\n\\n\\nSalcedo won easily with a time of 1:06.22. \\n\\n\\nLooking unsatisfied, she returned to her teammates and said, \"I felt pretty \\ngood, I was hoping for a better time.\" \\n\\n\\nStill, she set a city record. And heard the applause at the finish. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

In its 800-year history as a leaning tower, this is\\nthe first time such direct assistance has been necessary.\\nThe emergency measures do not stop here. The group of 14 international\\nexperts overseeing the fate of the tower this week agreed to a scheme to\\nstabilise the monument's famous incline. 'We are going ahead with the\\nplacement of 600 tons of lead slabs at the base of the tower,' says Prof\\nMichele Jamiolkowski of Turin Polytechnic, head of the experts' commission.\\nThe lead will be placed on the north side, opposite the tilt, will cover\\nabout a quarter of the tower's circumference and will be about three metres\\nhigh.\\n'This is an experiment in controlled subsidence,' says Prof Carlo Viggiani\\nof the University of Naples. 'Imagine the tower is resting atop a mattress:\\nif you press down on one side of the mattress, the tower will move.'\\nBy putting pressure in this way and eventually using perhaps 1,000 tons of\\nlead, the experts believe the 58.3 metre-high tower can be not only\\nstabilised, but pushed back to lessen its tilt.\\nThe tower has been closed since January 1990, when the rate of tilt was\\ninexplicably found to have increased from 1.2mm to over 1.3mm a year.\\nAlthough infinitesimal, the 750 tonne belfry at the top has moved nearly a\\nquarter of a metre from the vertical in the last 100 years. The accumulated\\ndeviation is now close to 5.5 metres and there were fears the building would\\neither topple over or break up under the stress of the increased tilt.\\nAfter all the past false alarms and eccentric proposals, one of which\\nsuggested propping up the tower with a Coca-Cola bottle, the government was\\nsufficiently concerned to appoint an international body of experts and set\\naside funding for a rescue operation.\\n'We may have been slow to go ahead with these emergency measures, but our\\ncommission has no proper secretariat and we have had to cope with Italian\\nbureaucracy,' says Prof John Burland of London's Imperial College.\\nProf Burland says it is the first time co-ordinated multi-disciplinary\\nscientific research has been carried out on the tower. His computer\\nsimulations on the movement of soil have been instrumental in the decision\\nto employ lead weights. 'These emergency measures now give us time to think\\nof longer-term solutions,' he says.\\nThe experts, the 17th commission since 1298, are working on the premise that\\nthe tower must continue to be seen as leaning and free-standing. Indeed,\\nthis is one of the rare instances in conservation where a monument's defects\\nare being consciously preserved.\\nThus, the experts have ruled out dismantling the tower and rebuilding it or\\nfollowing the suggestion of a Chinese engineer who claimed great success in\\nrighting pagodas. They want to strengthen the tower and reduce the tilt\\nslightly.\\nThe main difficulties concern the ground on which the tower stands, in the\\nmagnificent Campo dei Miracoli alongside the cathedral. The water table,\\ntraditionally close to the surface, has fallen in recent years, and this is\\nbelieved to have affected the tower's incline.\\nThe experts are now talking either of preventing further access to the water\\ntable around the tower by city users or of creating an underground barrier\\nwhich would maintain a constant water level around the tower.\\nA final solution is likely to take at least three years, and Mr Sergio\\nCortopassi, Pisa's Socialist mayor, is anxious to keep pressure on the\\npoliticians in Rome who control the purse-strings and the bureaucratic\\nshort-cuts.\\n'Pisa without the Leaning Tower would not be Pisa,' he says.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Experts estimate the work will cost $400 million. \\n\\n\\nSnakes alive: Train travel in China has always been an adventurous proposition, \\nbut it has become even more creepy of late. \\n\\n\\n\"For nearly one month, railway departments have seen various species of frogs \\nand snakes filling train aisles, crawling on luggage racks and even in \\nrestrooms,\" according to a report in China\\'s Legal Daily newspaper. \\n\\n\\nThe cause is the illegal capture and sale of frogs and snakes by Chinese \\npeasants with an eye for profit. Frog and snake meat are considered delicacies \\nin China, but demand has outstripped supply, resulting in \"wanton killing and \\ntrafficking\" by industrious hunters, according to the newspaper. \\n\\n\\nMore than three tons of wild frogs and toads and 1 1/2 tons of snakes were \\nconfiscated by Shanghai authorities in May alone, the newspaper said, adding \\nthat in one instance, 30 bags of live snakes weighing 1,650 pounds were \\ndiscovered being illegally smuggled on a freight car. \\n\\n\\nVan Gogh, van gone: A total of almost 1.3 million art lovers visited the \\n\"Vincent Van Gogh Retrospective\" during its four-month exhibition at \\nAmsterdam\\'s Vincent Van Gogh Museum and the Kroller Muller Museum in Otterlo. \\n\\n\\nThe unprecedented collection of masterpieces from museums and private \\ncollections around the world closed last Sunday, the 100th anniversary of the \\nDutch artist\\'s death. \\n\\n\\nThe Amsterdam museum, which normally attracts 700,000 visitors a year, \\nattracted 860,000 people since the exhibition opened March 31, while 431,000 \\nvisited the Otterlo museum, 62 miles from Amsterdam. \\n\\n\\nThe museums used a reservations system to cut down on the anticipated crush in \\nqueues, limiting visitors to 700 an hour in Amsterdam and 500 in Otterlo. The \\nsystem was observed with interest by officials from the Louvre in Paris, the \\nMetropolitan Museum of Art in New York and London\\'s National Gallery. \\n\\n\\nBig Easy riders: United Cabs in New Orleans has been encouraging riders to take \\nlonger rides in cabs by allowing them to use their Visa and MasterCards for \\nfares on local trips, city and plantation tours and, especially, airport trips. \\nThere\\'s a $5 minimum on all credit card charges. \\n\\n\\nBorder opening: Finland and the Soviet Union may open their border to allow \\nGermans to visit the graves of thousands of compatriots who fell in World War \\nII, the Helsinki newspaper Uusi Suomi reported. \\n\\n\\nIn return, a German war graves society is ready to pay $1.85 million U.S. to \\nhelp finance the road and rail connections that the two countries plan to open \\nto boost tourism. \\n\\n\\nGermans fought alongside Finns against the Soviet Union during the \\nFinnish-Soviet War of 1941-44, and many were buried in land later ceded to the \\nSoviet Union. There are thought to be as many as 5,000 German war graves north \\nof the 800-mile border. \\n\\n\\nFlea-ing Venice: Visitors to Venice this summer have been plagued by an \\ninfestation of water fleas. The insect\\'s bite produces a rash similar to a \\nsunburn, followed by dozens of painful blisters. Doctors have been inundated \\nwith patients suffering these symptoms, and Italian health authorities blame a \\ntype of water flea that lives in the algae on the city\\'s lagoons and thrives in \\nhot weather. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Its \\narchitects have designed an elegant facade without being fussy. \\n\\n\\nWhiteson laments \"inadequate detailing,\" but a more intricate treatment would \\ndetract from the serenity of the facade -- which accomplishes a massive task of \\nenclosure with grace. \\n\\n\\nMany of the features Whiteson finds objectionable are examples of good design. \\nFor example, Whiteson argues that the main lobby entrance (at 5th Street) is \\nobscured by the multistory illuminated glass wedges outside its recessed doors. \\nThese \"light fins\" are very interesting architectural elements that create a \\nsense of both procession and enclosure. They \"cloak,\" which is an appropriate \\nand delightful way of entering this obelisk to commerce, far superior to a \\nsolution that would carry the facade as a solid wall down to ground level. \\n\\n\\nAdmittedly, the entry at the north (Bunker Hill) side of the tower is weak. It \\nmay have been preferable to continue the bold south side motif (which Whiteson \\ndisliked) around the west facade of the building and up to this entrance. This \\nwould have surrounded the building on its public sides with an ascending screen \\nof large forms. \\n\\n\\nL.A.\\'s straight gigantic version of the Leaning Tower would have had a crooked \\nbase if this were done. As it is, however, the humble top-of-the Bunker Hill \\nentrance is a nice counterpoint -- like the servants entrance to a very ornate \\nmansion. I\\'ve always liked back doors. \\n\\n\\nOut of their constraints, the architects have created a composition of subtle \\nelegance. Over time, this building will be recognized as one of the great \\nsuccesses of the Postmodern period. Bravo! \\n\\n\\nBOB SARNOFF \\n\\n\\nLos Angeles \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

This project is,\" said architect Leason \\nPomeroy, president of the Irvine-based firm that designed the county\\'s new \\nairport terminal. \"Our community needs landmark architecture.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Rev. Robert H. Schuller on Sunday dedicated the $5.5-million spire, which \\nwas completed over the summer and is now one of the county\\'s tallest \\nstructures. New York architect Phillip Johnson, the designer of both the new \\nsteeple and the glass-walled church, was on hand for the ceremony. \\n\\n\\nBuilt with 9-foot reflective steel prisms, the 236-foot spire includes a \\n52-bell carillon and is topped by a beacon for aircraft. It also features an \\nunderground chapel with a revolving crystal cross. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s designed, engineered and constructed as a thing of beauty, a joy forever \\nto last literally for centuries,\" Schuller said. The tower is also earthquake \\nproof, he added. \\n\\n\\nJohnson, 84, told the congregation during the ceremony that he was surprised at \\nthe overall effect of his design. \\n\\n\\n\"It is so far more than I expected that it\\'s hard even to speak about it,\" he \\nsaid. \"I didn\\'t realize that what we have here, Robert, is a tower that is \\nbuilt of light. That celebrates the sun as great towers should. But in a new \\nway.\" \\n\\n\\nJohnson, who donated his design services, went on to say that he had help in \\ncreating the tower. \"I think you all know where that help came from.\" \\n\\n\\nJohnson also designed the 10-year-old cathedral, constructed of 10,000 panes of \\nglass and exposed rods and pipes, and featuring 90-foot-high glass doors. The \\nspire, or campanile, was part of the original plan, but wasn\\'t built because \\nSchuller\\'s church ran out of money. \\n\\n\\n\"If Philip Johnson hadn\\'t lived to be 84, it would never have been finished. \\nHe\\'s the only person who could have finished it.\" \\n\\n\\nAs of last September, the church was also $2 million short of being able to pay \\nfor the tower. But a gift in that amount from Newport Beach philanthropists \\nJohn and Donna Crean put the building fund over the top, sources said. The \\nspire is called the Crean Tower. \\n\\n\\nThe rest came from \"friends of the ministry,\" including $200,000 from \\nphilanthropist Armand Hammer and $1 million from Mary Tolerton Hood, widow of \\nClifford F. Hood, former president of U.S. Steel Corp. The still unfinished \\nchapel is named for her. \\n\\n\\nWhen people question the cost, Schuller said he replies that it is better to \\nfocus on how long the structure will last and how many people will enjoy it. \\nLYNN SMITH \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

The\\nfollies on offer cost between one guinea and 1m guineas.\\nMost follies were expensive jokes with no utility other than as somewhere to\\nstore the croquet sticks or shelter from the rain. Now, however, those that\\nsurvive are much sought after as unusual homes, built as many are in prime\\nscenic locations.\\nTake, for instance, Sway Tower, to the south of the New Forest. Headley\\nbelieves it is 'the greatest pure folly tower in Britain' - joint agent Fox\\n& Sons describes it as one of the most remarkable buildings in England.\\nThe tower, started in 1879, took Andrew Thomas Peterson six years to\\ncomplete; from the belvedere on the 218ft summit, there are breathtaking\\nviews as far as the Isle of Wight and Salisbury cathedral.\\nThe present owner, Paul Atlas, said: 'Peterson was an eccentric judge who\\nreturned from Calcutta determined to prove that it was possible to build a\\ntower without reinforced concrete.'\\nNo scaffolding was used by the 40 labourers working on the job. Atlas bought\\nthe cottage in the shadow of the tower in 1973; he bought the tower later\\nand poured all the family's energy and cash into its restoration after the\\n1987 gales.\\nIn June last year, it opened as one of Britain's most unusual hotels, with\\njust four bedroom suites housed in the tower with its 330 steps.\\nThere is an indoor swimming pool, a floodlit tennis court and other\\noutbuildings, including a snooker house. Together with the cottage, Sway\\nTower can be bought for one million guineas.\\nAnother folly on the agency's list is Hadlow Tower, soaring 170ft above\\nTonbridge, Kent. The grade-one listed, octagonal tower was built in 1838 as\\nan addition to Hadlow Castle, built by William Barton May in the late 18th\\ncentury and known as May's Folly.\\nThe current owner, Michael Kiesser, is looking for a partner to buy a\\nhalf-share in the folly for about 700,000 guineas, to establish some form of\\nleisure enterprise.\\nPavilions of Splendour has some decidedly unsplendid temptations as well;\\nthere is, for instance, Deepings Lodge, in Deene Park, Corby,\\nNorthamptonshire, which could be your home for just one guinea.\\nThe snag is that the guinea buys a 21-year full repairing lease, and there\\nis a lot of repairing to be done on the little 19th century stone lodge,\\nplus the provision of main services.\\nAfter many years as a hospital, Craig-y-Nos Castle, in Abercraf, Powys, has\\nbeen restored to the sort of elegance furnished by soprano Adelina Patti,\\nwho bought it in 1878.\\nPatti built a scale replica of Bayreuth State Opera House, plus aviary,\\nconservatory, winter gardens, chapel and many other rooms. Although much of\\nthe restoration is complete, there is potential for developing the remainder\\nof the castle.\\nThis means the 550,000 guineas price guide could be just a start, but there\\nis already a monthly turnover of about Pounds 30,000 from functions and\\nmusical events.\\nBut is it fair to describe builders of what we call follies as eccentric?\\n'My great-aunt Jessie would have said that her amphitheatre and temple of\\nthe winds were two of life's essentials,' said John Blake, who inherited\\nClovers, in Tenby, from the old woman.\\nJessie Allen lost her fiance in the first world war and threw herself into a\\ndrama teaching career at Cheltenham College and at her Welsh clifftop home.\\nMany a budding thespian had a first taste of Shakespeare in the\\namphitheatre.\\nJessie's Indian-style bungalow has now been replaced with a five-bedroom,\\nsingle-storey home, with distant views of Lundy and Caldy Island and the\\nDevon coast. There are five acres of land sloping down to private, sandy\\nbeaches.\\nThe amphitheatre, with tiered seats cut into the ground, has a raised stone\\nstage. Nearby is the temple, built by Royal Academician Alan Strawbridge; it\\nonce had glass wind chimes suspended from its domed cupola.\\nThe house, land and follies are offered for 250,000 guineas.\\nKnight, Frank and Rutley has had a good year for Shropshire follies. After\\nagreeing terms for two of the four follies at Weston Park, the firm now\\noffers Sham Castle in Acton Burnell, Shropshire.\\nBuilt in the 1780s as a music room for the Bruce Smythe family who owned the\\nsurrounding estate, the folly was restored in the 1980s and is now a\\ncomfortable home with remarkable views. The hexagonal first-floor drawing\\nroom and its intricate plaster-work ceiling is especially beautiful. The\\nagent eschews guineas, asking Pounds 185,000 for a 90-year lease.\\nAmong a number of follies on the market is a little castle and a stone boat\\nhouse on the Didlington Hall Estate, Norfolk; but Savills says a buyer will\\nhave to take on the 460-acres of lakes and farm and all the buildings as\\nwell. The original mansion was demolished in 1950 so this could be one of\\nthe best building 'plots' in the land. Savills also moves with the times,\\ngiving the guide price in pounds - Pounds 850,000.\\nLikewise with Hamptons, which suggests Pounds 200,000 for the octagonal\\ngazebo in the gardens of the original Richmond Palace, by the Thames. The\\nbeautiful folly, dating from the early 18th century, has been meticulously\\nconverted into a little home; among the features are arrow-slit windows, now\\nfilled with stained glass salvaged from a nearby church.\\nPavilions of Splendour: Tel: 0622-679447.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

On a clear day, the view from the\\ntop can stretch for 30 miles.\\nVisitors will be charged Pounds 3 a person, but after additional security\\nand ticketing costs, this will do little to help the finances of the\\nproject, which has debts estimated at Pounds 700m.\\nIt will provide the first opportunity in nearly 20 years to visit the top of\\nthe UK's tallest building. The 580ft Post Office tower (now the BT tower),\\nwhich held the record until the NatWest tower was built in 1980, has been\\nclosed to the public since 1973, when a bomb exploded in the restaurant.\\nThe Canary Wharf tower will be the tallest office building that can be\\nvisited in Europe, since Frankfurt's 841ft 6in Messeturm is off limits to\\nvisitors. However, an even loftier view is available from the the\\niron-framed, 985ft 11in Eiffel Tower in Paris.\\nThe tallest buildings in the US, the Sears Roebuck Building in Chicago and\\nthe World Trade Center and Empire State Building in New York, also court\\nvisitors. The world's tallest tower remains the 1,815ft CN Tower in Toronto,\\nwhile the UK's highest structure is the 1,265ft ITN mast in Lincolnshire.\\nThe Canary Wharf tower will be open on Saturdays and Sundays, from 10am to\\n5pm, from September 12.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nDecember 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHOOLS FAIL LATINOS IN ANY TONGUE; \\n\\n\\nEDUCATION: THE \\'CRISIS\\' OF TOO FEW SPANISH-SPEAKING TEACHERS IN L. A. IS \\nGROUNDED IN YEARS OF INSTITUTIONAL NEGLECT. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to be sympathetic with the Los Angeles Unified School District\\'s \\nexpressed frustrations in coping with 170,000 limited- and non-English-speaking \\nstudents (90% of whom are Latino). I cannot help asking, whose fault is it? \\n\\n\\nThe crisis in our schools did not come about by osmosis; it was the result of \\ndemographic changes that happened openly, and it was predictable. \\n\\n\\nAbout a decade ago, Mexico\\'s economic slide and wars in Central America created \\na flood of immigrants here. Add to this surges in Asian and Middle Eastern \\nimmigration, and the result is overcrowded and chaotic inner-city schools \\nstaffed by overworked people who cannot communicate with the students. \\n\\n\\nIn fairness to L.A. school administrators, some have lately seen the light and \\nattempted to attract bilingual teachers by offering a $5,000 annual bonus. The \\ndistrict also has developed a well-defined master plan for bilingual education. \\nThis is a start. But there are still glaring contradictions. The irony of the \\ndistrict sending recruiters to Spain and Mexico to find qualified \\nSpanish-speaking teachers is too much to take. Why, when the United States has \\na Latino population of more than 15 million, can\\'t we find Spanish-speakers at \\nhome? \\n\\n\\nOne of the answers is that fewer Latinos are entering teaching. In 1977, \\nnationwide 3,050 Latino college graduates received teaching certificates. Eight \\nyears later the number had declined to 2,533. \\n\\n\\nWhere are the Latino high school and college graduates? Surely, not all of them \\nare opening doors in business and the professions. Their absence in teaching, a \\nfield traditionally attractive to first- and second-generation immigrants, is a \\nmeasure of how public education is failing Latinos. \\n\\n\\nThe shortage of bilingual Spanish-speaking teachers and aides is just one of \\nproblems created by the district\\'s failure to motivate Latino students to \\ncomplete their education. \\n\\n\\nThere is obviously a link between the number of Latino teachers and the success \\nrate of teaching strategies such as bilingual education. Close to 60% of the \\nstudents in the L.A. district are Latino, while just over 10% of its teachers \\nare (about 6% are of Mexican or Central American extraction). \\n\\n\\nLatinos also suffer from their numerically small part in the teacher community, \\nwhich because of its massive size, greatly influences the district\\'s ideology \\nand political makeup. \\n\\n\\nAnd, of course, the dearth of Latino teachers deprives all students of Latino \\nrole models, leaving them to the influence of TV stereotypes. \\n\\n\\nIn a wider sense, the lack of representation cheats the Latino community \\nintellectually, allowing English-only kooks like LEAD (the Learning English \\nAdvocacy Drive) to get away with idiotic questions: \"The Irish, the Jews, the \\nItalians and the Poles made it, what\\'s wrong with you Mexicans?\" Well, nothing \\nis wrong with us Mexicans. The truth is that the public schools have not \\ntreated all groups equally. They slighted the first generations of European \\nethnics, only blessing their children or grandchildren, the so-called \\nbaby-boomers, with mass infusions of federal aid to education during and after \\nWorld War II. \\n\\n\\nDavid Hayes-Bautista of UCLA, in his book \"The Burden of Support -- Young \\nLatinos in an Aging Society,\" underscores this historical fact, writing: \"In \\n1940 the average Anglo had only 9.8 years of schooling. Comparatively few \\nCalifornians had graduated from high school, and college was but a distant \\ndream for most.\" At the time, Latinos averaged 5.6 years of schooling. Forty \\nyears later, the Anglo average had climbed to 12.9 years, the Latino to 9 \\nyears. The number of Anglo college graduates had tripled, from 7.2% to 21.2%; \\nthe Latino figure more than tripled, but from a meager 1.6% to 5.4%. In fact, \\nif it had not been for mass federal and state aid, supplemented by the G.I. \\nBill, the descendants of the European ethnics would still be in factories (if \\nthey hadn\\'t shut down or moved abroad). \\n\\n\\nCalifornia, up into the 1960s, was a leader in per-capita expenditures on \\neducation. But as the Latino and minority populations grew, and as the baby \\nboomers got older, California\\'s commitment to excellence waned. In 1971, \\nCalifornia was 19th in state spending; 12 years later it ranked 45th. Now, \\nalmost a decade of Gov. George Deukmejian\\'s stewardship has pushed California \\ninto a runoff for last place, making sure that Latinos won\\'t get the chance \\nthat the children of the Irish, Italians, Jews and Poles finally did. \\n\\n\\nIt is time to set the record straight: The great majority of Latinos in this \\ncountry have never set foot in a bilingual classroom. What has failed them is \\ngood old American education; bilingual education had nothing to do with it. \\nWhat is important about bilingual education is that it is an index of the \\neducation Establishment\\'s commitment to the education of Latinos. Its demise \\ncould signal that American society has finally learned to live with and not \\napologize for a permanent underclass. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

The center, \\nlocated at Crenshaw High School in Southwest Los Angeles, is a special Los \\nAngeles Unified School District program to help newly arrived immigrants adjust \\nto the U.S. education system. \\n\\n\\nThe master of ceremonies was from El Salvador, the pianist from Nicaragua and \\nthe choir from Vietnam, China and Mexico, among other places. Some students \\nperformed humorous skits to show off their newly acquired English, such as one \\nabout eating in a restaurant and finding a fly in the soup. One group of \\nChinese students offered a stirring dance symbolizing the struggle for \\ndemocracy in their homeland. \\n\\n\\n\"A lot of these kids are from troubled countries,\" teacher Guillermo Pasillas \\nsaid, \"yet they\\'re able to forget about that here. I see a lot of enthusiasm \\nand a lot of respect for education. They\\'ve been great to work with.\" \\n\\n\\nOpen since July 3, the Newcomer Center is one of two special schools for \\nimmigrants to be opened this year by the school district. The Crenshaw High \\ncenter, which started with a six-week summer session, will enroll up to 450 \\nhigh school students in the fall for a yearlong program to help prepare them \\nfor regular high school classes. \\n\\n\\nInstruction will be delivered in the students\\' native language for mathematics, \\nlanguage arts and U.S. history and culture. They also will receive intensive \\nEnglish instruction and physical education. \\n\\n\\nAbout 200 elementary pupils are expected at a second Newcomer Center opening \\nnext week on the site of the former Bellagio Road School in Bel-Air. \\n\\n\\nThe schools were the brainchild of former Board of Education member Alan \\nGershman, who proposed the program two years ago because he believed that the \\ndistrict needed to do more to ensure the success of the thousands of immigrant \\nstudents entering its schools. \\n\\n\\n\"They were dropping out in huge numbers,\" said Maria Olmos, who directs the \\nCrenshaw center, \"and we wanted to make sure that they would continue on in \\nschool.\" \\n\\n\\nMost of the newcomer students live near downtown Los Angeles and have taken a \\ndistrict bus to Crenshaw each day, Olmos said. More than 80% of the students \\nare natives of El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala. But others are from Hong \\nKong, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand. \\n\\n\\nAlthough most of the students emigrated with their families, about 10 left \\ntheir country without kin and are supporting themselves, according to school \\npsychologist Brad Pilon. \\n\\n\\nSome, like 17-year-old Rosa Saucedo from Mexico, said they find the U.S. \\neducation system confusing and more difficult than schools back home. But \\nothers, such as Ambi Bangis, 15, from the Philippines and Bussarin Kiewkram, \\n15, from Thailand, said they find the classes much easier. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t have to study,\" Ambi said. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

The district this year is \\nproviding bilingual instruction in just 13 magnet school classrooms. \\n\\n\\nDistrict officials say they are meeting the demand for Spanish-language \\ninstruction at magnet schools and that many Latino parents don\\'t want their \\nchildren bused to magnet schools outside their neighborhoods. \\n\\n\\nBut School Supt. Bill Anton agreed that the low enrollment of limited \\nEnglish-speaking students at magnet schools points to a problem. \"It\\'s not the \\nway it was set up,\" he said. \"We have to find out why we are not having \\n(bilingual) programs in the magnet schools.\" \\n\\n\\nSome education and legal experts say the numbers are appalling and blame the \\ndistrict for failing to recruit more non-English speakers. \\n\\n\\n\"Where you have schools that are set up to provide specialized instruction to \\nstudents of the district and one significant group of students are effectively \\nshut out, you have both a legal and ethical problem,\" said Peter Roos, an \\nattorney with Multicultural Education Training and Advocacy, a national \\npublic-interest law firm specializing in educational rights of minority and \\nimmigrant children. \\n\\n\\nRoos and several other public-interest attorneys are preparing to go to trial \\nearly next year in a 4-year-old lawsuit alleging that the district is unfairly \\nspending more money and employing more experienced teachers at schools with \\nhigher than average enrollments of white students, such as magnet schools. \\n\\n\\nThe district reserves between 30% and 40% of the seats in magnet schools for \\nAnglo children, although they make up less than 15% of the district\\'s total \\nenrollment of 625,000. Together, Anglo and Asian students make up nearly half \\nof the magnet school enrollment, even though the two groups make up only 20% of \\ndistrict enrollment. \\n\\n\\n\"There is a general attitude that the limited English-speaking student is a \\nsecond-class citizen,\" said Juan F. Lara, a professor at the Claremont Graduate \\nSchool and a resident scholar at the Tomas Rivera Center, a national institute \\nof policy studies. \"Look at school districts with large limited \\nEnglish-speaking populations and it becomes patently clear they are considered \\nan expendable population.\" \\n\\n\\nDistrict officials say there are no barriers to magnet schools. A magnet school \\nbrochure, including a version in Spanish, is distributed to students once a \\nyear. \\n\\n\\n\"All children may apply to magnet programs, we never limit it,\" said Assistant \\nSupt. Theodore T. Alexander Jr., who heads the district\\'s magnet schools and \\nother voluntary integration programs. \"But it is a misconception that everyone \\nin the district wants to be in a magnet.\" \\n\\n\\nThe district\\'s magnet schools and centers, which share facilities with regular \\nschools, have for years finished far ahead of the city\\'s regular schools in \\nalmost every measure of academic achievement including test scores, graduation \\nrates and college eligibility. Tens of thousands of children are on waiting \\nlists for magnet schools, which can accommodate fewer than 10,000 new students \\neach school year. \\n\\n\\nThe district does not keep track of the language proficiency of its magnet \\nschool applicants. But district officials say a shortage of bilingual teachers \\nand a reluctance by immigrant parents to send their children to schools outside \\nof their neighborhoods probably discourages limited English-speaking students \\nfrom applying to magnet schools. \\n\\n\\nDistrict records show that last year 1,237 limited English-speaking students \\nwere enrolled in 93 magnet schools and centers, which by design offer the sort \\nof equipment, curriculum and teachers found only in the best private schools. \\n\\n\\nOf about 8,000 students enrolled in 27 magnet schools and centers for only \\nhigh-ability and gifted students, only 102 were Spanish-speaking, district \\nrecords show. Another 200 or so gifted students who spoke languages other than \\nSpanish or English were enrolled in those schools. \\n\\n\\nThe Euclid Avenue School\\'s bilingual magnet center -- which opened last year -- \\nis the first and only in Los Angeles to offer classes in Spanish for gifted and \\nhigh-ability students, generally children who score in the top 2.5% to 4% on \\nstandard IQ tests. \\n\\n\\n\"The sad fact is students aren\\'t being identified as gifted until they learn \\nEnglish,\" said Euclid Principal Esther Castruita-McShane. \\n\\n\\nBright immigrant children should be identified as gifted or high ability and \\nthen offered special programs in their native language while they learn English \\npart of the day, said Sandra Kaplan, a visiting professor of education at USC \\nand the assistant director of the Los Angeles-based National/State Leadership \\nTraining Institute on the Gifted and the Talented. \\n\\n\\nKaplan has developed a series of tests to identify gifted students who speak \\nlanguages other than English. Teachers at Euclid Avenue School have been using \\nher techniques and this year identified 33 students as gifted. \\n\\n\\nThe school board in May, 1988, voted to give priority to the hiring of \\nbilingual teachers for magnet schools. \\n\\n\\n\"Magnet schools are the best kind of schools the district has to offer,\" said \\nEastside board member Leticia Quezada, who pushed for creation of the Euclid \\nAvenue magnet school. \"The fact is we spend more money in magnet schools \\ncompared to regular schools.\" \\n\\n\\nThe magnet school system was created nearly 15 years ago. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLANGUAGE STUDY PROGRAM IS A BIG SUCCESS ON A SMALL SCALE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the 435 students at Longfellow Elementary School in Clairemont -- all of \\nthem native English speakers -- the language of the day is Spanish. Similarly, \\nhablando Espanol is also the norm for more than 200 children at Horton \\nElementary in Southeast San Diego, while French is the langue for 80 students \\nat nearby Knox Elementary. At Spreckels Elementary in University City, about \\nhalf the school\\'s 600 students master Spanish and English together in daily \\nbilingual studies. \\n\\n\\nWelcome to the little-known world of foreign language study in San Diego \\nelementary schools. Out of 107 schools in the San Diego Unified district and \\nmore than 100 in smaller county districts, the special magnet programs at the \\nfour schools provide the only large-scale, continuing foreign language \\ninstruction for students at the elementary level. \\n\\n\\nWhile the programs get high marks from teachers, parents and independent \\nevaluators, their special status only points up the general lack of any \\nsecond-language curriculum below the secondary-school level, not only in San \\nDiego but throughout California and the nation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCall for Expanded Programs \\n\\n\\nA key recommendation from the June 1987 report on the future of San Diego \\nschools called for foreign-language instruction for all elementary school \\nstudents as part of expanded programs in world culture. That recommendation \\nparallels conclusions in nationwide educational reports calling for teaching \\nforeign language to more students and at an earlier age. \\n\\n\\nAlthough local school officials have acted on many parts of the 1987 \\nindependent study, they have offered no specifics regarding more language \\nstudy. Even at the secondary level, administrators concede that instructional \\nmethods need revamping, with more emphasis on oral-based teaching and less on \\nrote grammar so that students will pick up a second language in a more natural \\nway. \\n\\n\\nBut the same administrators point to the existing magnet programs as good \\nexamples of how language instruction could better proceed if a commitment to \\nextra money and time were made by members of the Board of Education. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTypical Classroom \\n\\n\\nA visitor entering one of the two kindergarten classes at Longfellow Elementary \\nfinds all the bulletin boards in Spanish and the class divided into several \\ngroups, with one cluster of munchkins singing a song in Spanish while a second \\nreads a story in Spanish and a third practices vocabulary using \\nSpanish-language work sheets. \\n\\n\\nFrom kindergarten through second grade, children receive all instruction in \\nSpanish. Beginning in the third grade, they receive 75 minutes of intensive \\nEnglish immersion so that they learn to read in English. Otherwise, the class \\ncontinues in Spanish. \\n\\n\\nA similar pattern is followed at Horton and Knox as well. \\n\\n\\n\"It takes a real commitment by parents to place their children in such \\nprograms,\" said Tim Allen, who directs second-language instruction for the San \\nDiego district. \\n\\n\\nThe language magnets fall under the district\\'s special integration academic \\nprograms first set up in the late 1970s to encourage voluntary ethnic mixing \\nand to avoid mandatory busing under court order. At Horton and Knox, which are \\nin predominantly minority areas, the language immersions are intended to \\nattract white students who live outside the area to bus to the schools. They \\nhave generally been successful in doing so. The only non-white students \\neligible for the immersions must live in the immediate school neighborhoods. \\n\\n\\nLongfellow is one of a handful of district schools without a neighborhood \\nfocus. All students must apply for admission. All students are selected only on \\nthe basis of balancing the school ethnically, and the school has a waiting \\nlist. \\n\\n\\n\"A key is that parents want to be certain that their children will still \\nmaintain their English,\" Allen said. \"And it is usually best for a student to \\nenroll beginning in an early grade.\" \\n\\n\\nLongfellow magnet coordinator Helen Sabala finds that many parents who visit \\nthe school for the first time express both excitement and bewilderment. \\n\\n\\n\"Yes, we teach the same basic concepts of math, reading, etc., as in other \\nschools but in Spanish,\" she told a group of parents the other day who are \\ncontemplating putting their children at Longfellow next year. \\n\\n\\n\"The teachers use a lot of repetition, a lot of body movement, such as pointing \\nto something,\" Sabala explained. \"The kids listen to the Spanish and, at first, \\nthere are non-verbal responses\" such as a student handing over an object that \\nthe teacher asks for in Spanish. \"And that leads to natural conversation \\ndeveloping after a while.\" \\n\\n\\n\"We begin formal English reading at the third grade, but we really encourage \\nparents to continue reading to their children in English at all grades. We\\'ll \\ntake care of the Spanish.\" \\n\\n\\nA district evaluation last year showed that immersion students at the \\nfifth-grade level did as well on standardized English tests in math, reading \\nand language as their peers at regular elementary schools. In addition, the \\nevaluation showed that the students develop Spanish-language skills comparable \\nto students who are native Spanish speakers. \\n\\n\\nAt Knox, teacher Kathleen Stark said that parents -- many of whom are \\nFrancophiles -- nevertheless do worry about whether the reading skills taught \\ninitially in French will transfer to English. \"And they do transfer,\" Stark \\nsaid. \"It\\'s sometimes quite remarkable.\" \\n\\n\\nSally McArdle at Knox, who gives the third-through-sixth graders their \\nintensive English reading lessons, said that, by the second semester of third \\ngrade, the transfer is almost always made. \\n\\n\\n\"Most already have the reading skills, and it\\'s just a matter of getting \\ncomfortable with English,\" she said. \"It\\'s funny when they recognize English \\nvocabulary by its French roots. . . . \\'That\\'s French, isn\\'t it?\\' you hear them \\nsay.\" \\n\\n\\nAt Spreckels, the bilingual magnet operates on a different philosophy. An equal \\nnumber of native Spanish speaking and English-speaking students are grouped \\ntogether for part of the day for music or other enrichment in Spanish or \\nEnglish, but are separated by language for part of the day for basic skills \\ninstruction. The Spanish speakers bus to Spreckels from Southeast San Diego; \\nthe English speakers are University City children whose parents choose the \\nprogram. White students from outside the area are not eligible. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport for Program \\n\\n\\nThe parents of Spanish-speaking natives have supported the Spreckels program \\nstrongly for almost a decade. For them, the curriculum allows their children \\nnot only to learn English but to maintain their Spanish, unlike regular \\ndistrict ESL instruction for the majority of Latino students, which is intended \\nonly to increase English fluency. \\n\\n\\nParents of neighborhood children have been much slower to warm to the program, \\nafraid that their children would suffer by not spending their entire day in an \\nEnglish curriculum. That fear has diminished, administrators said, since the \\ndistrict added a gifted enrichment component in English to the program four \\nyears ago. \\n\\n\\n\"The Spanish kids hear a lot more English here than they do in ESL at a school \\npredominantly Latino,\" Linda Giles, who teaches kindergarten at Spreckels, \\nsaid. \"And the Caucasian kids are hearing Spanish in real-life situations, too, \\nsuch as on the playground . . . we as teachers try to give a sense of being \\ntruly bilingual by sometimes talking in Spanish just to show that is all right, \\ntoo.\" \\n\\n\\nAdded fifth- and sixth-grade teacher Ivelisse Druid: \"There\\'s lots of oral work \\nhere, both with teachers and with each other. And we mix some of the reading \\ngroups as well.\" \\n\\n\\nPatti Garretson put her son, Andrew, in the program because she wants him to \\nknow Spanish growing up in Southern California. \"I work at (UC San Diego) \\nMedical Center and I know the importance of having a second language . . . and, \\nwhile some parents do fear that the program takes away from English \\ninstruction, I have found that the kids do most of their reading, writing and \\nmath in English.\" \\n\\n\\nAlthough Garretson considered the immersion programs, she believes in sending \\nher children to neighborhood schools. \\n\\n\\nAnd the Spreckels teachers, while saying that Spanish immersion for English \\nspeakers is a choice for parents to make, do not believe that a similar English \\nimmersion -- instead of a bilingual focus -- would work for Spanish speakers. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSink-or-Swim English \\n\\n\\n\"First of all, the Hispanic kids in sink-or-swim English would not get the \\nacademic support at home that Caucasian kids get in English while in a Spanish \\nimmersion,\" second-grade teacher Lydia Stevens said, adding that in the present \\nimmersion, the point is to teach students Spanish and not to replace their \\nnative language. \\n\\n\\nGiles said research shows immersions work best when the language of immersion \\nis in \"the so-called lower-status language,\" which in the United States would \\nbe Spanish. \\n\\n\\nTeachers in both the bilingual and immersion programs complained that there is \\npoor articulation for graduating sixth-graders wishing to continue their \\nlanguage study at the junior-high level. Second-language coordinator Tim Allen \\nconceded that the problem is not only with the lack of follow-up courses in \\nmost cases but with different methods of teaching at the secondary level. \\n\\n\\n\"The new framework from the California Department of Education calls for \\nteaching extensively through dialogue, through oral communication, but our \\ntexts still emphasize orderly grammar and many of our teachers haven\\'t had \\ntraining in new methods,\" Allen said. \"But this is the way we want to go, both \\nat secondary and also at elementary levels, if we can begin (more widespread) \\ninstruction at those grades.\" \\n\\n\\nSandra Scherf, a La Jolla High foreign-language teacher who has been trained in \\nthe new methodology, said that \"too many (secondary) students now go through a \\nprogram and learn to conjugate and read literature, but can\\'t speak with any \\nproficiency. \\n\\n\\n\"We want students to give responses that can be understood even if they are \\ngrammatically incorrect at first . . . with further exposure and practice, the \\nerrors get tidied up without resorting just to drills on verbs.\" \\n\\n\\nMost students leaving the existing elementary language magnets end up in the \\nmore traditional programs ill-suited to the preparation they have had. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMagnet Fails to Attract \\n\\n\\nStudents in the Spreckels program are eligible to continue to a junior-high \\nlevel bilingual magnet at Correia Junior High in Point Loma. Almost all the \\nSpanish-speaking students continue to Correia, since the bus ride there is no \\nlonger than that to Spreckels from their Southeast San Diego homes. \\n\\n\\nBut no neighborhood magnet student from the University City area has ever \\nattended Correia, because residents perceive that Standley Junior High, their \\ncommunity school, has better academic programs, teachers said. As a result, \\nCorreia magnet teachers must recruit new white students from the Point Loma \\narea who have had little or no Spanish study and therefore are far behind their \\nbilingual Spanish counterparts. And the Spreckels students who go on to \\nStandley discover that the Spanish classes there are geared more for beginning \\nstudy. \\n\\n\\n\"Standley truly has an outstanding academic program so the parents are \\nreluctant to send their kids outside of the University City area,\" Allen said. \\n\"But, because of the nature of the magnet philosophy -- it is set up to promote \\nintegration -- the continuing magnet isn\\'t at Standley.\" \\n\\n\\nAllen has worked on getting a better relationship between teaching styles at \\nSpreckels and Standley. \"Since the majority of Standley classes must be geared \\nto beginning students, I would like to see maybe one class geared to a \\ncontinuation of what is done at Spreckels.\" \\n\\n\\nSimilarly, students at Longfellow, Horton and Knox are eligible to continue \\nintensive language instruction at Memorial Junior High in Barrio Logan. But the \\nmajority choose to attend their neighborhood junior highs, in part because \\nMemorial is considered a \"dangerous\" school because of its location, despite a \\nhigh-powered magnet emphasizing languages and world culture. Language classes \\nat those neighborhood junior highs are also geared largely to beginning study. \\n\\n\\n\"And Memorial is not a true immersion, since we don\\'t have that beyond the \\nelementary level,\" Allen said. \"We do have a special Spanish language-arts \\nclass for the immersion students\" and students from Knox can take advanced \\nFrench courses at San Diego High School on special transfers, he said. \\n\\n\\nAllen said that teaching methodology will change significantly at the secondary \\nlevel over the next several years, especially with new teacher training and \\nwith new texts becoming available in 1990. But he said that an oral-based \\nforeign-language program at elementary schools depends on the philosophical \\nbent of top administrators and the board of trustees. \\n\\n\\n\"Will foreign language be considered part of basic skills or an add-on?\" Allen \\nsaid. He noted that the district\\'s new common-core curriculum content does not \\ninclude additional foreign language requirements. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what the answer is going to be.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nSeptember 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'MEXICAN SCHOOL\\' ALUMNI TO HOLD LA HABRA REUNION; \\n\\n\\nEDUCATION: IT HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR 40 YEARS, BUT GRADUATES OF SEGREGATED WILSON \\nSCHOOL STILL REMEMBER. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEstella Reynoso remembers the slap. She was in the third grade with other \\nMexican-American children from a nearby migrant camp and was one of the few who \\ncould speak English. \\n\\n\\n\"I remember the teacher asking me to read out loud from a book in English. I \\nstumbled on a difficult word and couldn\\'t say it. The teacher got up from her \\ndesk, came over to me and slapped me hard in the face,\" Reynoso said. \\n\\n\\n\"You see, we couldn\\'t speak Spanish at Wilson School in those days, and I guess \\nshe got mad at me because she wanted to use me as a good example of a Mexican \\nwho could speak English,\" said Reynoso, now a 50-year-old mother of two, who \\nplans to attend an unusual reunion Saturday. \\n\\n\\nOpened in 1920, Wilson was nothing more than a series of weathered, \\ngray-colored barracks known then as the \"Mexican school.\" Its student body, \\nalmost entirely Latino, consisted of the children of Mexican farm workers who \\nirrigated and picked oranges and lemons. White students went to another school. \\n\\n\\nForty years after the closure of Wilson Grammar School, its graduates, like \\nReynoso, who was forced to attend the racially segregated school, are holding a \\nreunion at the old American Legion Hall in La Habra. \\n\\n\\nWilson\\'s alumni have become educators, homemakers, librarians, attorneys and \\nelected officials. A list of Who\\'s Who among the graduates includes Jesus \\n(Jess) Flores, who pitched professionally in the old Pacific Coast League and \\nbecame a baseball scout for the Pittsburgh Pirates; Louis H. Zuniga, who became \\nthe first Mexican-American to be elected to the La Habra City Council; and Cruz \\nReynoso (no relation to Estella Reynoso), who became a state Supreme Court \\njustice. \\n\\n\\n\"It definitely was a segregated school,\" recalled Candalario Mendoza, 71, from \\nPomona, who will be recognized at the reunion as the first Mexican-American \\nteacher hired in La Habra. \"It was 100% Mexican, and it was comprised of mostly \\nMexican-Americans. It was a kindergarten-through-sixth-grade school and it had \\nabout 200 kids.\" \\n\\n\\nThe school was nestled near the citrus groves of the Bastanchury Ranch and near \\nthe Orange Packing Co., one of the largest in Orange County at that time. \\nMendoza recalled that there were about 42 students to a classroom, which were \\nold Army barracks brought from the Army Air Force base in Costa Mesa to the \\nschool site at 2nd and California streets. Condominiums have replaced the old \\nschool, which has since been razed. \\n\\n\\nAlfredo Zuniga, 57, who attended Wilson, said the barracks school stood in \\nstark contrast to Lincoln Grammar School, the new, brick schoolhouse across \\ntown that opened in 1920 for the district\\'s white students. \\n\\n\\n\"In those days, Wilson was for the Mexicans and Lincoln was for the whites. It \\nwas truly separate and unequal,\" said Zuniga, who is a librarian in East Los \\nAngeles. \\n\\n\\nReynoso, the former justice who now is in private practice, said the grammar \\nschool had a very \"important influence\" in his life. He, like many of the \\nothers, has bittersweet memories. \\n\\n\\n\"When we went to register for school at the brick school, they told us, \\'No. \\nYou don\\'t go here. You have to go to Wilson.\\' Wilson had these wooden barracks, \\nit looked very second-class to us. We asked why are we being sent to this \\nschool. They said, \\'Because you\\'re being sent here to learn English.\\' To my \\nolder brothers and I, it sounded suspicious. We were raised in Brea and already \\nknew English.\" \\n\\n\\nYet Reynoso recalled learning about art and United States geography, and \\ndeveloping a love for education that helped carry him through college and law \\nschool. \\n\\n\\nMendoza said the district promoted English under the theory that if the \\nchildren were to ever get good jobs they would have to learn it. He agreed, in \\npart, but also felt \"it was a shame\" that the children couldn\\'t speak Spanish \\nin school. \\n\\n\\nWhen Mendoza was hired in 1942, he said, \"The Mexican parents thought it was \\njust great to have a teacher who could speak Spanish, while the white teaching \\nstaff thought I was a novelty. We were so separated from the Anglo community in \\nLa Habra that they probably didn\\'t even know there was a Mexican-American \\nteacher.\" \\n\\n\\nHe found a small apartment to rent in La Habra. On his days off and after \\nschool, he would drive his young students around town in his 1937 blue \\nChevrolet as a reward for outstanding academic work. \\n\\n\\n\"I would say to them, if they read this story or that book, then I would take \\nthem to a movie theater or a basketball game. I was strict with them, but I \\ndidn\\'t have to worry about discipline. Not after the first day,\" Mendoza said, \\nadding that they had to sit in the rear of the theater because it was also \\nsegregated. \\n\\n\\nMendoza said parents would show up on the first day of school to visit him. \\nThey brought in small tree limbs or belts, and they would tell him in Spanish: \\n\"There is my son Raymundo. He is the one sitting over there in the corner. \\nHere\\'s the belt that I want you to use on him if he acts out of turn.\" \\n\\n\\nMendoza said the children\\'s eyes would widen at the sight of their parents in \\nclass. Although corporal punishment was allowed then, he didn\\'t have to use it, \\nhe said. But he did put the child\\'s name on the belt and stuck it in a closet \\n\"just in case.\" \\n\\n\\nDecades after Mendoza left the district, he saw a newspaper story that Gov. \\nEdmund G. Brown Jr. had appointed a Cruz Reynoso to the California Supreme \\nCourt. So he wrote to Reynoso asking if he had attended Wilson Grammar School. \\n\\n\\nReynoso responded that he not only had attended, but that he remembered the \\ntime Mendoza took the basketball team to watch a basketball game at nearby \\nFullerton College. \\n\\n\\n\"I remember when Cruz first saw the inside of that basketball gym,\" Mendoza \\nsaid. \"You have to understand that these boys played basketball on hard-packed \\ndirt. When Cruz saw that the college players actually wore fancy uniforms, he \\ncouldn\\'t believe it. All their games were played in street clothes. It was \\nquite a shock.\" \\n\\n\\nCecil Brower, now 90 and living in La Verne, was the school superintendent who \\nbroke the color barrier by hiring Mendoza. He did it, he said last week, \\nbecause he believed that the children and parents deserved a teacher who could \\nspeak Spanish. \\n\\n\\n\"That was an all-Mexican school and there was prejudice against the Mexicans in \\nthis district,\" Brower said. \"When Mendoza started working at that school, it \\nwas more than anxiety, it was prejudice.\" Years later, however, Brower helped \\nusher in integration, which led to the closure of Wilson school in 1950. \\n\\n\\nPart of the school was later sold to a milk company, marking an end to La \\nHabra\\'s early beginnings, Brower said. \\n\\n\\n\"I knew the courts wouldn\\'t let us have schools of just one race like that, and \\nI told the board that we can get in trouble having this school. They didn\\'t \\nlike what I had to say, but they agreed, and we began integrating our schools,\" \\nBrower said. \\n\\n\\nYears later, Alfredo Zuniga\\'s younger brother, Enrique Zuniga, 51, a school \\ncounselor at Fullerton College, made an interesting discovery. \\n\\n\\nThe younger Zuniga visited the school district\\'s main office and learned that \\nin 1919, the residents of La Habra had passed a $90,000 school bond to build \\nWilson and Lincoln schools. Only $15,000 was used to build their school, said \\nAlfredo Zuniga, while more than $75,000 was used to construct Lincoln, which \\nthe white children attended. \\n\\n\\n\"At that time, when we were very young, we didn\\'t think too much about it. Now \\nthough, as educators we can see what we were deprived of. . . . We thought we \\nwere going to their schools, never our schools. Even though we were American \\ncitizens and were born here, we always thought we were going to their schools, \\nbeing taught by their teachers and going to their parks. As educators, we knew \\nwe got a second-class education,\" Zuniga said. \\n\\n\\nLike Estella Reynoso, Zuniga said he also recalled being slapped at Wilson and \\npaddled like other students for getting caught speaking Spanish. \\n\\n\\nBut despite the adversity in their young lives, the alumni and their teacher \\nare proud of their beginnings. It\\'s one of the reasons they\\'ve organized the \\nreunion, said Enrique Zuniga. In part, it\\'s a social gathering. Yet, it\\'s also \\na social statement. \\n\\n\\n\"Hey, we had 13 children in our family,\" Zuniga said, \"and we had a one-bedroom \\nhouse in Campo Colorado, it was house No. 69. At night it would be all bodies \\nin there. We were poor, but you know, you learn something from being poor. You \\nlearn how to be proud.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Assimilation requires a daily \\nassessment of this value. The Hispanic-American family is not anti-education. \\nWe are striving to assert our presence within an educational system that is \\nculturally biased toward Anglo-American values; individualism, rationalism, \\nempiricism. \\n\\n\\nAdopting English as a second language causes students to make decisions \\nregarding attachment and loyalty.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nNovember 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSCHOOLS ARE FRUSTRATED BY BILINGUAL CLASS DEMANDS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Pacific Palisades Elementary School, Principal Terry Arnold has only two \\nbilingual teachers and six aides to educate 120 Spanish-speaking students who \\nare bused to her school each day. \\n\\n\\nAt Cowan Elementary School in Westchester, teacher Susan Blackwell-Brown hands \\nout puzzles to occupy the half-dozen third graders in her class whose language \\nshe cannot speak. \\n\\n\\nAt Wilbur Elementary School in Tarzana, neighborhood parents complain that \\ntheir children\\'s education is suffering as teachers struggle to cope with new \\nstudents who speak no English. \\n\\n\\nAcross the Los Angeles Unified School District, students, teachers, parents and \\nadministrators are frustrated with a situation in which large numbers of \\nelementary school students who cannot speak English are forced to fend for \\nthemselves in classes where no one speaks their language. \\n\\n\\nA record 20,000 students -- 7,000 more than last year and most of whom speak \\nlittle English -- are being bused from their overcrowded neighborhoods this \\nyear to schools ill-equipped to receive them. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a struggle,\" said Blackwell-Brown. \"You have no material, you don\\'t speak \\ntheir language . . . sometimes you know they\\'re not getting anything, but \\nthere\\'s nothing you can do.\" \\n\\n\\nThe district\\'s bilingual education plan calls for the use of bilingual teachers \\nor aides whenever a school has more than 10 students who speak the same foreign \\nlanguage on any grade level. About 90% of foreign students speak Spanish, and \\nmost who speak other languages are scattered throughout the district and often \\nget special instruction. \\n\\n\\nBut there are nowhere near enough bilingual teachers and aides to go around, \\nforcing school principals to scrap traditional teaching plans and adopt \\napproaches such as team teaching and cooperative learning, which may have \\nstudents as young as first grade changing classrooms and teachers several times \\neach day. \\n\\n\\n\"Theoretically, all limited-English-proficient kids should be in classrooms \\nwhere someone speaks their language,\" said Michael Ginsik, an adviser in the \\ndistrict\\'s bilingual program. \"Realistically, they probably are not.\" \\n\\n\\nBilingual education -- the notion that children should learn in their native \\nlanguage before they tackle subjects in English -- has been passionately \\ndebated nationwide. \\n\\n\\nSteadfast Policy \\n\\n\\nThe Los Angeles district -- with about 170,000 of its nearly 600,000 students \\nspeaking little or no English -- has remained steadfast in its support for \\nbilingual education. \\n\\n\\nBut a burgeoning population of students who do not speak English, and a lack of \\nteachers and classrooms, threatens to accomplish what bilingual education\\'s \\nopponents have not been able to do -- force students to learn in English-only \\nclassrooms. \\n\\n\\nMost of the district\\'s bilingual teachers are assigned to schools in South and \\nEast Los Angeles, where most Spanish-speaking children reside. But because \\nschools in those areas are overcrowded, the district has \"capped\" many of them \\nand buses the overflow to schools on the Westside and in the San Fernando \\nValley. \\n\\n\\nOfficials had predicted that a large proportion of the district\\'s enrollment \\ngrowth this year would be among non-English-speaking students as immigrants \\ncontinue to flock to the central city. But the problem has been finding \\nclassroom space for the new students, while maintaining racial balance and \\nminimizing travel time on buses in the sprawling 500-school district. \\n\\n\\nOfficials hope a new $5,000 annual pay bonus will attract more bilingual \\nteachers. But for now, many schools are forced to rely largely on bilingual \\naides -- primarily college students who work three hours each day with groups \\nof non-English-speaking students. \\n\\n\\nSchools which receive bused-in students are given money by the district to hire \\none aide for every 30 students they receive, but finding the aides has proved \\nto be a challenge for some schools. \\n\\n\\n\"When you\\'re at a school like this, where there\\'s no resident Spanish-speaking \\npopulation and it\\'s far away from any college with (an education) program, it\\'s \\nhard to attract aides,\" said Pacific Palisades Principal Arnold, who has six \\naides for 10 bilingual classrooms. \\n\\n\\n\"Who wants to travel way out here and back for a three hour-a-day job?\" she \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\nTo cope with the shortage, many principals move their aides around to cover \\nmore than one classroom -- but that still leaves many Spanish-speaking children \\nalone in classes with English-speaking teachers for much of the day. \\n\\n\\nExcept for the 40 minutes each day that Blackwell-Brown has a bilingual aide in \\nher classroom, she tries to make do with the smattering of \"street Spanish\" she \\npicked up teaching in East Los Angeles years ago. \\n\\n\\n\"Sometimes the kids just sit there . . . you know they\\'re not getting anything. \\nYou feel so guilty, but your back is against the wall. What can you do?\" \\n\\n\\nSome overburdened schools try to maximize use of teachers and aides with \\nconcepts spelled out in the district\\'s master plan for bilingual education. But \\nthose non-traditional approaches have spawned some opposition from teachers and \\nparents. \\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got teachers who\\'ve been here for years and done a wonderful job and \\nsuddenly they\\'ve got these children they can\\'t reach,\" said Charlotte McKinney, \\nhead of a district task force dealing with bilingual education. \"It\\'s very \\nfrustrating. \\n\\n\\n\"The way it used to be -- the self-contained classroom with one teacher where \\nthe kids get to know each other and stay together -- that\\'s a wonderful model, \\nbut it doesn\\'t work in this district anymore.\" \\n\\n\\nThe district is sponsoring training sessions to teach principals and teachers \\nconcepts such as team teaching -- where two or three bilingual classrooms are \\ncombined, with a bilingual teacher and a teacher who only speaks English -- and \\ncooperative learning groups, where children work with other children, in effect \\ntutoring their peers. \\n\\n\\nThose approaches have incensed some English-speaking parents who feel that \\ntheir children are being shortchanged. \\n\\n\\nStudents as Tutors \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re living in an area where there are a lot of housekeepers, so some of our \\nkids have picked up a little Spanish,\" said the mother of a Wilbur student, who \\nasked not to be identified. \\n\\n\\n\"Now my daughter\\'s time is spent tutoring the Spanish-speaking kids because the \\nattitude of the teachers is they can\\'t help the kids. They don\\'t speak their \\nlanguage, so they\\'re ignoring them, they\\'re leaving them behind.\" \\n\\n\\nParents have also complained about sheltered English, the teaching method many \\nmonolingual teachers must employ in classrooms that include Spanish-speaking \\nyoungsters, using a slower pace, simple words, more visuals and more acting \\nout. \\n\\n\\n\"The teacher winds up having to teach at the lowest common denominator,\" said \\nElaine Parlen, whose daughter is in the fourth grade at Wilbur. \"That\\'s not \\nfair to our kids who are trying to learn and to stretch.\" \\n\\n\\nComplicating the situation is the fact that many Spanish-speaking students did \\nnot reach their new schools until several weeks into the school year -- and \\nsome are still coming -- forcing principals to dismantle carefully-conceived \\nplans and switch teachers and students around to try to accommodate the \\nnewcomers. \\n\\n\\n\"We got far more youngsters than we anticipated,\" said Wilbur Principal Frank \\nSpecchierla, whose San Fernando Valley school received about 200 \\nSpanish-speaking students from inner-city schools this semester. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s been a real challenge for everyone,\" he said. He and the teachers have \\nbeen so preoccupied with the logistics of accommodating the new students, \"we \\nhaven\\'t really had a chance to worry about things like what reading groups (the \\nSpanish-speakers) should be in. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s meant changes for a lot of our kids, but some schools had it worse,\" he \\nsaid. \"I know some principals who had to reorganize four or five times.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

But after three weeks, \"now I sleep well . . . and we \\nusually stay up talking until midnight.\" \\n\\n\\nFlores and 29 other ninth-graders, all children of current and former migrant \\nworkers, have been immersed not only in college dormitory life but also in \\nlearning English, math and computer skills. \\n\\n\\nThe project, entitled Basic Education Skills for Tomorrow (BEST), is among the \\nfirst in the nation to pair counselors, who were raised in migrant family \\nhouseholds, with a younger generation of migrant youths in a college setting. \\nIt is perhaps the most ambitious program in the Southland aimed at the 45% of \\nLatinos who drop out of high school before the 10th grade. \\n\\n\\n\"We try to dangle the college experience in front of these kids so they know \\nthat finishing high school is an option,\" said Margarett Lewis, assistant \\ndirector of Migrant Education in Orange and San Diego counties. \"We also have \\nto convince migrant parents that they have to hold on a little longer before \\nthey send their kids to work.\" \\n\\n\\nUnder a $32,000 grant from the Department of Education, the project began in \\nJune with the selection of 30 youths from Orange County schools. Most were shy, \\npoor academic performers and termed \"at risk\" -- likely to drop out. Many spoke \\nonly Spanish and some had only recently crossed the border from Mexico. \\n\\n\\n\"The migrant community in Orange County is all at risk,\" said Dr. Isaac \\nCardenas, director of the Chicano studies department at Cal State Fullerton, \\nwho was chosen in mid-June to lead the program. \"We wanted to take the kids \\nbefore they drop out and give them role models.\" \\n\\n\\nCardenas, himself the son of migrant workers, decided to hire resident advisers \\nwho also had lived through poverty, language problems, and transience. \\n\\n\\n\"When we started looking for staff, we wanted advisers who could communicate \\nwith the parents and become leaders for the kids,\" Cardenas said. \"We wanted \\nthem to go to the kids\\' homes, see how they live, and make the parents feel \\nconfident about what we\\'re doing.\" \\n\\n\\nIn late June and early July, the counselors visited the families and found some \\nreluctance about the program. Parents of the girls, who traditionally are more \\nsheltered in Latino homes, were especially skeptical, Cardenas said. \\n\\n\\nEventually, most of them agreed. On the first day, parents and their children \\narrived to see the campus. \\n\\n\\n\"For a lot of them, coming into a nice new condo with a microwave oven and \\neverything else was culture shock,\" said chief adviser George Herrera, son of \\nMexican immigrants who is studying for a master\\'s degree in fine arts at \\nFullerton. \"Some of them come from alcoholic homes, tough situations, and this \\nreally freaked out many of them.\" \\n\\n\\nAt first the new students were shy, said counselor Julia Amavisca, a \\n34-year-old Cal State Fresno graduate student. \\n\\n\\n\"They were really afraid when we began here, but slowly they have started to \\nget more comfortable.

Under the new \\nplan, most Latino students are taught in Spanish for all but 20 minutes of the \\nday, and can graduate high school without ever demonstrating proficiency in \\nEnglish. \\n\\n\\nLEAD, a nonprofit organization of concerned teachers, parents and education \\nexperts across the country, is dedicated to reforming -- not eliminating -- \\nbilingual education by emphasizing modern English language development \\ntechniques. Not only does LEAD recommend that the native tongue of non-English \\nspeaking children be used to clarify difficult new words and concepts, whenever \\npossible and appropriate, as English is being learned, it actively promotes \\nforeign language study for monolingual English-speaking students. \\n\\n\\nMoreover, no officer of LEAD ever made the statements Acuna attributed to it. \\nFor what it\\'s worth, I am bilingual, and I never learned a second language by \\nbeing taught exclusively in English. \\n\\n\\nAcuna neglects to mention national surveys which indicate that 80% of Latino \\nparents of limited-English speaking children believe bilingual program emphasis \\nshould be placed on teaching English. \\n\\n\\nThe days of sink-or-swim can never be allowed to return, but neither should \\nLatino children be abandoned in an institutionalized underclass simply because \\nof an inability to communicate effectively in English upon entering the \\nAmerican public education system.

            "{'text': \"\\n\\n\\nMarch 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOMMENTARY; \\n\\n\\nSANTA ANA SCHOOLS MEET CHALLENGE OF ETHNICALLY VARIED STUDENT BODY \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere's a new student to be educated in the 21st Century. \\n\\n\\nAs superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District, I see evidence \\ndaily of the increasing number of Hispanic and other minority students \\nenrolling in Southern California schools. \\n\\n\\nWith approximately 43,000 students, Santa Ana Unified is the largest school \\ndistrict in Orange County and the ninth largest in the state. Seventy-eight \\npercent of our students are Hispanic and an additional 11% are from Pacific Rim \\ncountries. Approximately 56% of our students are classified as limited English \\nproficient (LEP). Students in our district speak nearly 40 languages and \\ndialects. \\n\\n\\nIn addition to the many countries and languages they represent, they also bring \\nvarying goals and values into our system. Children from Central America, \\nCambodia, Vietnam and Laos know the horrors of war. Besides teaching the \\neducational essentials, we must also teach them democracy. \\n\\n\\nThe challenge of the 21st Century is to acculturate this diversity into a \\ncohesive, cooperative student population. Because SAUSD has had to face these \\nchallenges before some of our neighbors, we may have reached some conclusions \\nor tried some alternatives that could be useful to others. \\n\\n\\nWe must take a serious look at what we're doing to equip our teacher corps. Our \\nactive relationships with UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Chapman College and \\nRancho Santiago College allow us to collaborate on a number of activities that \\nbenefit their students and ours. For example, As part of the focus on teacher \\ntraining, our director of Bilingual/English as a Second Language program makes \\npresentations to UCI teacher trainees about the realities of teaching in \\ntoday's multicultural schools, and part of our cooperative efforts with Rancho \\nSantiago allows prospective teachers hands-on opportunities at one of our \\nelementary schools. \\n\\n\\nSAUSD offers free cultural awareness and Spanish-language training for teachers \\nin addition to continuing staff development. \\n\\n\\nHispanic families and others who have immigrated to this country have done so \\nto find a better life and success. Whatever our feelings about the numbers of \\nimmigrants coming to our shores, it is our job to educate the children of our \\ncommunities and to help them become successful. \\n\\n\\nTo achieve that goal, I tell students that they must first learn English and \\nthat education must be their No. 1 priority. In my outreach to our Hispanic \\nfamilies, my repeated message is that the key to a brighter future for their \\nchildren is education. \\n\\n\\nSanta Ana Unified is also in the process of hiring a community liaison to \\ninvolve our total community in supporting the education system. We have a very \\nstrong parent group -- Padres Unidos -- at Madison Elementary, and we want to \\nhave this kind of involvement at each school so that all our parents can have \\ninput into their children's education. \\n\\n\\nIn collaboration with Cal State Fullerton, we offer Family Math for elementary \\nschool parents. This program allows parents and children to come into the \\nschools at night and learn, in their native language, about the math program \\ntheir children are studying and about how they can help at home. \\n\\n\\nSAUSD is also developing a videotape to help parents understand how they may \\nbecome involved at school, how to check their children's progress with teachers \\nand what social services are available to them. \\n\\n\\nTo help non-English-speaking students and their families in their transition \\ninto our district, we have developed a Registration and Testing Center to \\nassess students' language and educational abilities and to offer parents a \\nchoice of English-acquisition programs. This centralized facility also takes \\nthe burden of testing and processing new students off the individual school \\nsites. From July through December, more than 3,000 students were served by the \\ncenter. \\n\\n\\nOn school campuses we have instituted newcomer (at elementary) and EASE (at \\nsecondary) classes to help students prepare for the regular classroom. They \\nreceive instruction in emergency English skills, learn procedures for getting \\nlunch and supplies and become familiar with the campus and its rules. \\n\\n\\nThese responsibilities, too, were once handled in individual classrooms as new \\nstudents registered throughout the year. \\n\\n\\nMany of our students' needs are great. It is not unusual for our district to \\nreceive new, young students who do not know how to hold a crayon or who can not \\neven name their colors. We frequently receive high-school-age students who not \\nonly do not speak English, but who also are illiterate in their native \\nlanguage. \\n\\n\\nMany of this district's top students, along with students from UCI and Rancho \\nSantiago, are involved in after-school tutoring. The YMCA this spring will \\nbegin an after-school program in our district, and we have been guaranteed \\nfunding to begin a school readiness program next fall. Children as young as 3 \\nwill take part in this effort to help them enter school on equal footing with \\ntheir peers. \\n\\n\\nAnd we must continue to re-examine our efforts. A year ago, we put together a \\ntask force to study our services to limited-English-speaking students. They \\ncame back with more than 50 recommendations we are now addressing. \\n\\n\\nAs an example, through the efforts of our director of secondary curriculum, the \\nUC system has agreed that all LEP or bilingual content area courses are \\nacceptable for their entry requirements, as are their English-only \\ncounterparts. LEP algebra I would be viewed no differently than the standard \\nalgebra I. \\n\\n\\nSAT preparation courses are offered free in summer school, and we've increased \\nthe number of students continuing their education after graduation. Nearly 80% \\nof our graduates pursue some form of higher education. Last year UCI did a \\ntranscript survey and determined that 23% of our seniors were qualified for UC \\nschools. That number is up from 18% from the previous year. \\n\\n\\nTurning Point, Peer Assistance, Neighborhoods in Action are all a part of our \\ntotal community approach to communicating with and helping our students and \\ntheir families. We recently produced our first bilingual newsletter, and our \\ncable TV bulletin board now offers messages in Spanish as well as English.

If mom and dad -- or just one of them -- care enough about what goes on \\nin class to get involved with the process -- from helping with homework to PTA \\nbake sales -- that student is going to do well. \\n\\n\\nSo Secretary of Education Lauro F.

But Cavazos is oversimplifying a complex social problem and, \\namong all national education leaders, he should know better. \\n\\n\\nA Mexican American, Cavazos was appointed to the Cabinet by two different \\npresidents to give a Latino perspective on education, Topic A to most Latinos. \\nAs one of the nation's largest and fastest-growing immigrant groups, Latinos \\nknow upward mobility in this country starts where it did for all the immigrants \\nwho preceded them: in American schools. \\n\\n\\nBut the world in which Latino children -- in fact, all youngsters -- grow up \\ntoday is far more challenging than what previous generations faced. There is \\nless manual labor today, so more schooling is needed just to qualify for the \\nmost basic jobs. In too many families both parents must work merely to make \\nends meet, leaving less time to help with homework or attend school meetings. \\nThere are more distractions for modern kids, from relatively benign things like \\nradio and TV to real dangers like gangs and drugs. Add the language barrier for \\nmany Latinos, and you have an inkling of how daunting a task Latino parents \\nface just getting their kids through high school, much less college. \\n\\n\\nEducators argue, with some evidence to back them up, that getting Latino \\nparents involved in the schools requires special efforts at outreach -- \\ninviting them in Spanish and making them feel welcome at the school. But that \\ntakes extra time and money when schools are scrambling just to pay for basics \\nlike textbooks and computers. So Cavazos' challenge is not just prodding \\nresistant Latino parents, but reluctant public officials (like his boss, \\nPresident Bush) to ante up more money for innovative efforts that help the \\nlearning process along. If Cavazos could pull that off, Latino students \\nwouldn't be the only ones to benefit. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJuly 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLATINO PANEL OFFERS IDEAS TO BRIDGE BILINGUAL GAP \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLynne Gadbury helps decide whether students with limited English skills also \\nhave learning disabilities that would qualify them for special education \\nprograms. \\n\\n\\nIn the last school year, she says, she rejected almost half of the students \\nthat teachers recommended for special education, and sent them back to regular \\nclasses. \\n\\n\\nTeachers said the children were not creative and were having trouble expressing \\nthemselves, according to Gadbury. But she says the children, rather than being \\nslow learners with disabilities, simply could not speak English. And most of \\ntheir teachers could not communicate in the students\\' native language. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrowing Problem \\n\\n\\nThe inability of students and teachers to communicate is a growing problem in \\nthe Long Beach Unified School District, officials acknowledge. \\n\\n\\nOne of every four students in the district, including half of the Latino \\nstudents, cannot speak English proficiently. But there are so few bilingual \\nteachers that some special classes for non-English-speaking students are being \\ntaught by teachers who speak nothing but English, school officials say. \\n\\n\\nAlarmed by the shortage of bilingual teachers, and Latino students\\' low test \\nscores and high dropout rate, a Hispanic Advisory Committee has submitted to \\nthe Board of Education a series of proposals, including a recommendation that \\nall teachers and administrators at some schools be required to learn a second \\nlanguage. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigher Pay Urged \\n\\n\\nThe five-member committee also recommended that the board: \\n\\n\\n* Pay bilingual teachers a higher salary. \\n\\n\\n* Agree to \"an immediate\" increase of 10% to 20% in the number of minority and \\nbilingual employees. \\n\\n\\n* Encourage bilingual teacher aides to attain teacher credentials. The \\ncommittee\\'s report did not offer a specific plan, but committee members said an \\ninternship program would be one possibility. \\n\\n\\nBecause of the lack of bilingual teachers, many students not fluent in English \\noften end up in regular classes, where they are \"left to fend for themselves \\nand sink or swim,\" said committee member Jerome Torres. \"That\\'s why our kids \\nare doing so badly in the system.\" \\n\\n\\nLatino high school seniors in the district recorded below-average test scores \\nlast spring in the California Assessment Program. While the overall average for \\n12th-graders was 218 in reading and 234 in mathematics, Latinos averaged 198 in \\nreading and 206 in math, according to district statistics. \\n\\n\\n\"The system is failing in meeting the needs of these children. The district is \\nmonolingual and monocultural,\" Torres said. \\n\\n\\nLatino children face a bleak future unless the public school system can offer \\nrole models and teachers who can communicate with students, committee members \\nand other Latino leaders said. \\n\\n\\n\"What do we want for our future?\" Edna Molina-Tobias, president of the Assn. of \\nHispanic Educators in Long Beach, said in an interview. \"Do we want them to be \\nbusboys and grape pickers? Is that what we are destined to be?\" \\n\\n\\nOverall, school board members appeared receptive to the report, which board \\nmember Jenny Oropeza called \"excellent.\" \\n\\n\\n\"For me, it\\'s probably the most critical education issue we face in the Long \\nBeach Unified School District,\" Oropeza said recently. \"How are we going to \\nteach these children who don\\'t speak English? It\\'s our responsibility. And I \\ndon\\'t think we\\'re doing it.\" \\n\\n\\nBoard member Bobbie Smith said: \"We know we have not done well in terms of \\nreaching Hispanics and other limited-English speaking populations. But the \\ndistrict is working hard to recruit bilingual instructors and minorities.\" \\n\\n\\nA big part of the problem, district officials said, is the dearth of available \\nminority and bilingual teachers. For example, while 29% of the district\\'s \\nstudents are Latino, only 4% of about 3,000 teachers are Latino, according to \\ndistrict statistics. \\n\\n\\nOfficials say they are trying to hire more Latinos and Asians, but few are \\napplying. Supt. E. Tom Giugni said that of 382 applications received in recent \\nmonths, 17 were from Latinos, for example. Of the 200 teachers hired last year, \\n20 were Latino, he said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Accepted Practice \\n\\n\\nThe shortage of bilingual teachers has prompted district officials to hire some \\nnew teachers on the condition that they will learn a second language within \\nthree years, said Felice Strauss, president of the Teachers Assn. of Long \\nBeach. The practice is accepted by the state and done in other districts, said \\nMike Garcia, program administrator for Language Development Services. \\n\\n\\nBut there is little follow-up to ensure that the teachers do indeed learn a \\nsecond language. \"Unfortunately,\" Garcia said, \"we don\\'t have the staff to \\nfollow on it as much as we would like.\" \\n\\n\\nCommittee members cited the district\\'s difficulty in recruiting bilingual \\nteachers in urging the school board to make internal changes, such as requiring \\nteachers, administrators and other support staff to learn a second language if \\nat least 30% of the students in their school can\\'t speak English. \\n\\n\\nIf that requirement had been in effect in the last school year, teachers and \\nadministrators in 19 schools would have been affected, according to Roberto \\nUranga, the Hispanic committee\\'s chairman. \\n\\n\\nMolina-Tobias, who teaches English language development at Benjamin Franklin \\nJunior High School, said such a requirement would be \"revolutionary, but we \\nhave to do something. \\n\\n\\n\"We are professionals. We have to keep up with the times. If that means taking \\ncourses in another language, so be it.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisagreement Expressed \\n\\n\\nBoard member Smith said the mandatory language requirement is \"something we \\nshould take a look at. It\\'s an interesting idea. . . . The average rational \\nperson knows that children have better self-esteem and tend to achieve better \\nwhen they have role models or people who can speak their own language.\" \\n\\n\\nOther board members and school officials disagreed with the proposed language \\nrequirement. \\n\\n\\nMyrna Fujimoto, principal at Thomas Jefferson Junior High and one of the \\ndistrict\\'s first bilingual teachers in the 1970s, said that a second-language \\nrequirement would be difficult to enforce. She suggested, instead, that \\nteachers receive special training in how to deal with students who do not speak \\nEnglish properly. \\n\\n\\nGadbury, who speaks Spanish and has been screening students for the special \\neducation program since September, said she also favors special training. \\n\\n\\nBoard member Jerry Shultz praised the report, but expressed reservations about \\nrequiring teachers to learn a second language. He said he favors the concept of \\na pay differential for bilingual teachers and a program to encourage bilingual \\naides to become teachers. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConcerns Not Named \\n\\n\\nSchool board President Harriet Williams said the board probably would not \\napprove a second-language requirement for at least a few years. Even then, it \\nwould probably apply only to new teachers. Supt. Giugni and Strauss, of the \\nteachers\\' union, both said they have \"some concerns\" with a language \\nrequirement, but they declined to elaborate. \\n\\n\\nWilliams and Strauss also expressed concern about the recommendation to offer \\ndifferential pay to bilingual staff members. \\n\\n\\n\"Right now, I\\'m not for it,\" Williams said. \"So many of our teachers give \\nextra.\" It would be unfair, she said, to pay some more than others. \"I get the \\nfeeling from staff and teachers that it would be very divisive.\" \\n\\n\\nStrauss said that the best solution would be to make teaching a more lucrative \\nprofession in general. Bilingual people, she said, too often are lured away by \\ncompanies offering jobs with higher salaries and more prestige than teaching. \\n\\n\\n\"A lot needs to be done to improve the status of teachers,\" Strauss said. \"We \\nneed to make teaching a profession people want to get into\" by increasing all \\nteachers\\' salaries and reducing class sizes, she said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaff to Review It \\n\\n\\nGiugni said the district\\'s staff will review the report before individual \\nsuggestions are forwarded back to the school board for further consideration. \\n\\n\\nDuring the June 12 board meeting, Williams told the committee: \"This is a good \\nreport.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nMarch 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30 TRANSLATORS TELL IMMIGRANT PARENTS HOW TO HELP CHILDREN \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout 250 eager learners flocked to Rincon Intermediate School last Saturday, \\nbut they weren\\'t trying to chalk up extra credit. They were parents attending a \\nRowland Unified School District conference on ways to give their children a \\nboost in school. \\n\\n\\nAnd they were learning in their native tongues. \\n\\n\\nSome 30 translators with command of Spanish, Mandarin, Korean and Tagalog (for \\nthose from the Philippines) helped fill classrooms of the West Covina school \\nwith a cacophony of sound. \\n\\n\\nClusters of parents sat at tables around their respective translators during \\nmost of the lectures, usually conducted in English. Groups of parents would \\nmurmur, nod their heads in agreement and sometimes laugh a step or two behind \\nthe rest, after hearing the punch line in their language. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrientation to Society \\n\\n\\nThe daylong Multilingual Parent University was the first districtwide parent \\nworkshop sponsored by the 19,000-student district, which includes Rowland \\nHeights and portions of La Puente, Walnut and West Covina. \\n\\n\\nThe workshop was intended mainly as an orientation to American society for the \\ndistrict\\'s ethnically diverse community, said Anaida Colon-Muniz, bilingual \\neducation coordinator for the district. \\n\\n\\nParticipants were given a package of curriculum summaries in English and \\nSpanish, referral sources for psychological and drug treatment services, and \\nbrochures on parents\\' responsibilities in education. \\n\\n\\nColon-Muniz noted that the student population has undergone \"a tremendous \\nchange\" in ethnic composition over the past two decades. \\n\\n\\nThe percentage of Latinos attending the 21 schools in the district has nearly \\ndoubled from 26% in 1970 to 46% today, while Asians increased from 5.3% to 22% \\nin the same period. \\n\\n\\nThe workshop was the brainchild of Supt. Sharon Robison, who had a survey \\nconducted in five languages last year to find out what topics parents would be \\nmost interested in hearing about. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrugs and Gangs \\n\\n\\nAbout 26 speakers explored issues such as school culture, choices other than \\ncollege, communicating with children, and parenting in America. \\n\\n\\nGus Frias, coordinator of Operation Safe School, an Orange County Department of \\nEducation anti-gang program, addressed the problems of drugs, gangs and peer \\npressure. Social worker Nancy Lin from McClaren Children\\'s Center spoke in \\nMandarin about how to talk to children about school. \\n\\n\\nSome parents asked how to approach sex education. Others did not understand \\ntheir children\\'s new-found rebelliousness. \\n\\n\\n\"I told them to insist on the big things,\" Lin said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore Workshops \\n\\n\\nAnother speaker, Howard Kwon, advised immigrant parents to overcome feelings of \\npowerlessness in a strange country and to not give their children too much \\nfreedom. The Korea-born Kwon is the special programs coordinator for the ABC \\nUnified School District, with headquarters in Cerritos. \\n\\n\\n\"Respecting parents -- we need to import that,\" Kwon told his listeners. \\n\"Fathers have the responsibility to guide.\" \\n\\n\\nAmong his audience in a Chinese-speaking cluster was Meng-I Pan, whose son \\narrived last fall from Taiwan. The kindergartener is struggling to learn \\nEnglish. \\n\\n\\n\"He hasn\\'t been here very long, so I want to help him understand the school \\nenvironment,\" she said in Mandarin, adding that it was great having \\ntranslators. \\n\\n\\n\"I wish they would have more (workshops) so I can learn more things,\" said \\nLourdes Vasquez. The mother of a first-grader at Northam Elementary School in \\nLa Puente, she left Mexico for California a decade ago. \\n\\n\\nShe was pleased that her group got to watch a Spanish video on the possible \\nreasons why a child misbehaves, while others watched a similar tape in English. \\nVasquez said she learned that she should calm down and talk to her children \\nbefore getting angry at them for putting off doing homework. \\n\\n\\nSamantha Moon, who emigrated from Korea six years ago, said she had learned a \\nlot. She said she picked up valuable tips on ways to encourage her two \\nelementary school-age sons to do their homework, such as reading with them \\ninstead of watching television. \\n\\n\\nThe workshop was also an effort to sensitize educators to the diversity they \\nface, said Sally Mentor, associate superintendent of educational services. \\n\\n\\n\"Face-to-face contact is a powerful reminder of how much our community has \\nchanged,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nMentor is developing a seven-hour cultural training program for administrators \\nand staff this fall. \\n\\n\\nShe said the district is concerned with issues deeper than obvious cultural \\ndifferences such as dance or music. \\n\\n\\nUsing videotaped interviews with students and parents, her program will explore \\ndifferent gender expectations, how discipline is handled at home and how \\ncommunications between schools and the home can be improved. \\n\\n\\nCommunication is essential because sometimes parents do not understand what \\ncertain classes may involve, she said. For example, she said some parents were \\nshocked when their children performed at the end of a modern dance class. \\n\\n\\n\"They were moving their bodies in ways that in some cultures are totally \\nunacceptable,\" Mentor said, adding that some parents were also surprised simply \\nto see the dancers in tights. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJune 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPARENTS\\' ROLE STRESSED AT LATINO EDUCATION HEARING \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore than 150 parents, educators and business and community leaders from Los \\nAngeles County and beyond turned out Tuesday for a federal hearing on ways to \\nimprove the educational track record for Latino students. \\n\\n\\nMany sought funds for specialized programs, bilingual teachers, anti-dropout \\nprojects and new schools and updated equipment. \\n\\n\\nBut the dominant theme of the hearing, the last held on a five-city tour by \\nPresident Bush\\'s Task Force on Hispanic Education, was parental involvement. \\n\\n\\n\"Data has repeatedly shown that parental participation is the most critical \\nfactor behind the achievement of high levels of academic performance among all \\nage categories and ethnic groups,\" U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos \\nsaid in opening the hearing at the county Office of Education in Downey. \\n\\n\\nLast spring, Cavazos, the first Mexican-American to hold a Cabinet-level post, \\nangered Latino leaders by saying parental attitudes are responsible for many of \\nthe achievement problems of Latino students, including a high school dropout \\nrate nearing 40%. \\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday, noting that Latino youngsters will represent 20% of the school-age \\nchildren in the United States by the year 2080, Cavazos said, \"The future \\nprosperity of cities like Los Angeles depends on how well we educate our \\nchildren,\" especially those most likely to founder in the present public \\neducation system. \\n\\n\\n\"Sadly, Hispanic students are a disproportionately large part of this at-risk \\ncategory,\" Cavazos said, adding that the problem becomes more urgent as the \\nproportion of young Latinos entering the work force continues to increase. \\n\\n\\nIn Los Angeles County, Latino students make up nearly 50% of all public school \\nstudents. In the giant Los Angeles Unified School District, the proportion is \\n62%, or 372,221 students. About 55% of the 18,131 who dropped out of the class \\nof 1989 were Latinos, according to Supt. Leonard Britton. \\n\\n\\n\"Those who do not value education will find not the \\'American Dream\\' but the \\nharsh reality of limited opportunities and frustrated hopes,\" Cavazos said. \\n\\n\\nBut Gabriel Alvarez, a parent who serves on a school district advisory \\ncommittee, said Latino parents want to participate but often are made to feel \\nunwelcome or feel they do not speak English well enough. \\n\\n\\n\"The Spanish community is being offended by Dr. Cavazos\\' saying they don\\'t want \\nto participate. They would like to,\" Alvarez said. \\n\\n\\nAlthough she did not testify, Sylvia Corona, a mother of three who works a \\nswing shift and volunteers at Belvedere Elementary and Belvedere Junior High \\nschools, attended the hearing with other East Los Angeles mothers \"because I \\nwant to be involved. . . . I want a better education for my kids.\" \\n\\n\\nStuart E. Gothold, superintendent of the county education office, said schools \\nhave a responsibility \"to make all parents welcome.\" \\n\\n\\nCity School Supt. Britton, in seeking federal dollars, told the 10-member task \\nforce that \"parent-education programs are critical. . . .

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGRADS PUT IN GOOD WORD FOR LESSONS IN ENGLISH \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer classes are finally over for these 25 boisterous pupils. \\n\\n\\nAfter months of intense lessons, they are looking forward to a little fun. But \\nnot necessarily at Splash Mountain or on the beach. \\n\\n\\nThese students are more likely to prefer sipping some freshly brewed tea, \\nstrolling through a park or just staying indoors and engaging in some \\nold-fashioned conversation. \\n\\n\\nOn Friday, the students -- 25 Vietnamese-American senior citizens -- graduated \\nwith distinction from summer English classes sponsored by the Vietnamese \\nCommunity of Orange County Inc. in Santa Ana. \\n\\n\\nThe average age of the students was 70, and the oldest student was 83. \\n\\n\\nThe program is one of only two in Orange County that specialize in teaching \\nEnglish to elderly Southeast Asian refugees. The classes also familiarize them \\nwith Western ways. \\n\\n\\n\"I am newly come here,\" said Nien Le-Van, the oldest student. \"I want to talk \\nto (my) grandchildren.\" Le, a slightly built man with a wavy white beard, is \\nrespectfully called Anh Hai, \"oldest brother,\" by the others in the class. Le \\narrived in the United States three years ago at age 80. He began learning \\nEnglish a year later. \\n\\n\\nFor others in the class, learning English has given them a new way to be \\ncreative. \\n\\n\\n\"I want to write poetry,\" said Bong Ho, 72, who is also fluent in French. She \\ncame to the United States six years ago. But she admits that picking up English \\nis harder for her now because she is older. \\n\\n\\n\"I study every day,\" Ho said. \"I read every day. Sometimes easy. Sometimes \\nhard.\" \\n\\n\\nMary Payne Nguyen, an adult education teacher from the Garden Grove Unified \\nSchool District, has been the students\\' guide to Western culture and the \\nlanguage they seek to master. \\n\\n\\nThe center began holding classes for seniors about five years ago in a small \\nroom in a shopping mall storefront on West McFadden Avenue. \\n\\n\\nOrange County has more than 325,000 residents who are 60 or older, said Nancy \\nSchneider, supervisor of the county\\'s Senior Citizens Information and Referral \\nprogram. Of those, an estimated 7,200 are of Vietnamese background. \\n\\n\\nThose who have trouble learning English sometimes face loneliness and have \\ntrouble understanding -- and being understood by -- their own English-speaking \\nchildren and grandchildren, said Minh Ngoc Le, who coordinates the seniors \\nprogram for the center. \\n\\n\\nSince June, the 25 seniors who graduated Friday had been walking, biking and \\ncatching buses and shuttles so they could get to class and study about George \\nWashington and the U.S. Constitution, as well as basic English. They also \\nlearned about hamburgers, street signs and slang. \\n\\n\\nDuring the school term, each student was grouped according to fluency. Some \\nbegan without knowing how to even read or write in Vietnamese. Others had \\nalready learned the basics of English and were picking up American phrases, \\nsuch as, \"Have a nice day.\" \\n\\n\\nAt the graduation ceremony, the seniors shared sweet buns, croissants, giant \\npeaches, 7-Up and jasmine tea. There would have been 30 students, but Payne \\nNguyen excused five because they had to baby-sit grandchildren. \\n\\n\\nThe ceremony began with the students singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" Some \\nwere shy and preferred to mouth it, while others belted out the words as loud \\nas they could. \\n\\n\\nOne student, Wen Y. Yu, pulled out a pocket-size copy of the anthem to make \\nsure he got the words right. \\n\\n\\n\"Learning English is one more reason for these seniors to get out of bed in the \\nmornings,\" Payne Nguyen said. \"They need to feel productive.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nOctober 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOR IMMIGRANTS, ACCENT ON SPEECH; \\n\\n\\nEDUCATION: FULLERTON CLASS TEACHES ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION TO THOSE WHO WISH TO \\nSPEAK CLEARLY FOR PROFESSIONAL OR PERSONAL REASONS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSitting around a library table, 10 adults from three continents listened \\nattentively as Susanne Flatley emphasized the importance of the jaw in proper \\npronunciation. \\n\\n\\n\"In English, we encourage you to really move your jaw,\" Flatley said. \"You have \\nto do that to speak clearly.\" \\n\\n\\nThat tip and others offered in a Fullerton class on how to speak without an \\naccent were closely followed at a recent session by a group of immigrants \\nseeking to improve their pronunciation for professional and, in some cases, \\ndistinctly personal reasons. \\n\\n\\nTypical of those pursuing a course of study gaining popularity in \\nimmigrant-rich Orange County were Josef Mair, who speaks with a thick Austrian \\naccent, and Dora Harrigan, his wife, whose English is flavored with the Spanish \\nof her native Peru. \\n\\n\\nMair said it was his stepson, Bernard, 14, who provided the motivation. \\n\\n\\nThe couple\\'s contrasting accents are so startling that Mair, who recently \\nmarried the boy\\'s mother, said his stepson is frequently embarrassed when his \\nparents open their mouths. \\n\\n\\n\"I notice when we go to a baseball game that he doesn\\'t want me to speak to \\npeople,\" said Mair, 49, a salesman. \\n\\n\\nThe Placentia resident lived with that frustration until his wife spotted a \\nnotice about the class, which began Oct. 3 at the Hunt Branch Library in \\nFullerton. It is sponsored by the city of Fullerton Community Services \\nDepartment. \\n\\n\\nStudents paid $44 each to enroll in the four-week class, which has also been \\noffered in Anaheim and soon will begin in La Palma. Other students in Flatley\\'s \\nclass hail from Japan, the Philippines, Mexico and Taiwan. \\n\\n\\nAll have jobs dealing with the public, and are frustrated at the repeated \\nexplanations they must give to people who do not understand their thickly \\naccented English. \\n\\n\\n\"The goal in this class is not to become a native American speaker,\" Flatley \\nsaid. \"The goal is to become more intelligible.\" \\n\\n\\nAccent reduction classes are relatively novel in Orange County, despite the \\narea\\'s huge influx of immigrants from all over the world in recent years. While \\nsome native-born Americans find some foreign accents amusing, the immigrants do \\nnot, Flatley said. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s really not a laughing matter,\" Flatley said. \"Many of these people deal \\nwith the public and it\\'s very frustrating because they have to repeat what they \\nsay.\" \\n\\n\\nHarrigan, for example, said that her Spanish-accented English hampers her \\nability to communicate with the public in her position as a caseworker for the \\nCalifornia Department of Economic Development. Dealing with a mixture of \\nSpanish-speaking and English-speaking clients, Harrigan said she sometimes has \\ndifficulty making herself understood in English. \\n\\n\\n\"I just want to improve so it will be easier for me to do the job I do,\" said \\nHarrigan, who immigrated to the United States 15 years ago from Lima, Peru. \"I \\nalso feel like I can have a better chance to go to college.\" \\n\\n\\nSpeech patterns are formed in childhood from one\\'s native language. An accent \\nresults when the person learns a new language requiring the production of \\nsounds different from the native language. Spanish-speaking people, for \\nexample, have trouble with English words containing the sound of \"th,\" because \\nthere is no \"th\" sound in Spanish, Flatley said. \\n\\n\\nFlatley began teaching accent reduction classes two years ago, using tapes and \\nsound exercises to try to replace existing speech habits that cause an accent \\nwith new habit patterns that reduce the accent. \\n\\n\\nTo help accomplish this objective, students follow the format of \"Pronouncing \\nEnglish as a Second Language,\" a San Francisco-originated private course which \\nis offered in most major cities throughout the United States. The program \\ncovers three phases: learning to hear and produce the troublesome English \\nsounds, practicing the difficult rhythms and phrasing of English and practicing \\nthe new speech patterns in casual conversation. \\n\\n\\nThe class being taught every Tuesday night in Fullerton is only an \\nintroduction. During the first class, students recited such troublesome phrases \\nfor foreigners as, \"Of course,\" \"I was afraid this would happen\" and \"She hates \\nbeing late for class.\" \\n\\n\\nFlatley mixes the recitations with more tips for proper pronunciation. The \\nposition of the tongue is important. While speaking many foreign languages \\nrequires use of the back of the tongue, American English uses the tip of the \\ntongue, Flatley said. \\n\\n\\nFlatley\\'s partner, Jocelyn Piper, using chalk and a blackboard, explained that \\nEnglish is a particularly difficult language to pronounce because it has about \\n50 sounds but only 26 letters to carry those sounds. The five vowels used in \\nEnglish can be pronounced several ways, depending on the word, Flatley said. \\n\\n\\nFlatley demonstrated the difficulty in vowel pronunciations by asking her \\nstudents which one of the vowels in the word \"diploma\" had the \"uh\" sound. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s the \\'o,\\' \" Mair answered incorrectly. \\n\\n\\n\"If it was the \\'o,\\' it would be \\'dipluhma,\\' \" Flatley said. \\n\\n\\nBreaking into small groups, the students recited phrases together and \\nindividually, as the teachers listened and corrected. The phrases included such \\ntongue-twisters as \"Ask any bashful man if he can dance,\" and \"A great sound \\ncame from the right side of the door.\" \\n\\n\\nThen they practiced difficult words. John Liu, a chemist who immigrated here \\nfrom Taiwan, stumbled over the simple word \"toe,\" pronouncing it \"to-eh.\" He \\npronounced it correctly, though, after repeating it. \\n\\n\\nAnd Mair\\'s big nemesis was the word \"pail.\" He pronounced it \"payul,\" but got \\nit right after several more attempts. \\n\\n\\nAt the end of the session, Flatley tried to console wounded egos. \\n\\n\\n\"English is so difficult,\" she said, \"even for those of us who grew up speaking \\nit.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK REVIEW; \\n\\n\\nFRESHENING UP THE IMMIGRANT SAGA \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Americans: An Oral History by Al Santoli (Viking: $19.95, 392 pages) \\n\\n\\nOne of the great elements of the American myth -- and, at the same time, one of \\nthe great truths -- is that we are a nation of immigrants: every family, with \\nthe exception of American Indians, came here from somewhere else. Al Santoli \\nfreshens up the immigrant saga in \"New Americans,\" a series of self-narrated \\nprofiles of 18 recent immigrants and refugees from around the world who are now \\nstruggling to make a new life in America. \\n\\n\\n\"We are now experiencing the most awesome surge of immigrants and refugees in \\nmodern times,\" explains Santoli, who estimates that about 600,000 legal \\nimmigrants (\"and at least that number of illegal entrants\") arrive in America \\nevery year. \"The newcomers, mostly Asians, Latins, Creoles, Africans, Muslems \\nand Slavs, are not only changing the ethnic makeup of America, but also \\ncreating a dramatic impact in many communities.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMasters Manhattan Vernacular \\n\\n\\nSantoli, a journalist of Italian descent who is married to a Vietnamese \\nimmigrant, set himself the task of measuring that impact by finding and \\ninterviewing these \"new Americans.\" The families profiled in his book are drawn \\nfrom the remarkably diverse roster of recent immigrants from Afghanistan, the \\nPhilippines, Poland, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Ireland, Guatemala, South Korea, the \\nSoviet Union, Cambodia, Mexico, Italy, Laos, England, Haiti and Cuba. His \\nchoices include some fairly successful and well-assimilated people, but he does \\nnot leave out the immigrants who are still struggling and still suffering. \\n\\n\\nWe meet Maniya (Honey) Barredo, for example, a Filipino immigrant who is today \\nthe prima ballerina of the Atlanta Ballet. Barredo is one immigrant who quickly \\nmastered the distinctly American vernacular of Manhattan, where she studied at \\nthe American Ballet Center: \"I let go of my insecurities and worked my tush off \\nto earn a full scholarship at the school,\" she says. \"I\\'ve grown here as a \\nwhole person and have developed as an artist without anyone pushing me -- \\nexcept myself.\" \\n\\n\\nWe also meet the family of Trong Nguyen, a Vietnamese refugee who has helped to \\nturn the blighted Uptown neighborhood of Chicago into a vibrant Little Saigon. \\nSays Nguyen, who has mastered another aspect of the American idiom: \"Uptown is \\ncalled the Ellis Island of Chicago.\" (His wife, Thanh, speaks in a more somber \\nvoice: \"When we first came to Chicago, I cried a lot,\" she explains. \"In the \\nfactory where I worked . . . most were Mexicans, some legal, but also many \\nillegal aliens. They acted like, as Vietnamese say, \\'Old ghosts bully new \\nghosts.\\' \") \\n\\n\\nNot everyone, of course, is quite so well-adjusted. Josef Patyna, a former \\nSolidarity activist from Poland who now works in a non-union factory in Rhode \\nIsland, has discovered that America is not necessarily a kind or gentle place. \\nWhen the Polish-Americans in the neighborhood did not offer to help his newly \\narrived family, he quickly learned the hard lessons of self-reliance in \\nAmerica: \"At the time, our feelings were hurt,\" he remarks. \"But, looking back, \\nmy wife and I are very happy, because we helped ourselves. Everything we now \\nhave came from our own work.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd, like many immigrants, he despairs of the isolation that afflicts American \\nlife: \"We aren\\'t afraid about the next day or what will happen with the \\npolice,\" he says. \"But we have no close friends here.\" \\n\\n\\nIndeed, these are men and women who live in the real world, and they are wholly \\nunsentimental about the hard life of a new immigrant. A young mother from \\nHaiti, for example, is caught in the familiar trap of welfare bureaucracy: \\n\"Here I don\\'t have anyone to watch my kids so I can look for a job. Even if I \\nwas working, most of the money I could earn would go to pay a baby sitter, and \\nany small income would disqualify me for state help. And now, with the new \\nimmigration law, it is illegal for someone to hire me.\" \\n\\n\\nStill, she prefers Miami\\'s Little Haiti to the grimmer life in Port-au-Prince: \\n\"Even though my life is uncertain,\" she says, \"I have food. I can say anything \\nI want to say. There are no Macoutes or police who bother me.\" \\n\\n\\nMany of these immigrants talk at length about the hardship and turmoil in their \\nnative lands. Mohammad Daud Nassery, a pediatrician who escaped from \\nwar-ravaged Afghanistan, describes the hothouse politics of his homeland -- and \\nthe horrors of his escape across a blasted wartime landscape -- in a kind of \\ngrim poetry. \"Houses in ruins, mosques in ruins,\" Nassery remembers. \"Skeletons \\nlittered fields and the sides of trails. Bones of animals . . . bones of \\nhumans.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBittersweet Memories \\n\\n\\nSignificantly, these immigrants are eager to unburden themselves of their \\nbittersweet memories, but they have learned that their American neighbors are \\nnot very interested in recollections of the places left behind, or the agonies \\nof oppressed people in faraway lands. \"I think it makes my husband very happy \\nto have the opportunity to talk with you,\" Krystyna Patyna, wife of Solidarity \\nactivist Josef Patyna, tells Santoli. \"For the first time in a long while, he \\nhas somebody who is interested in the subject of Solidarity.\" \\n\\n\\nSantoli has allowed these \"new Americans\" to tell their own tales, and they \\noffer an unvarnished glimpse of immigrant life in the \\'80s. (Among the rights \\nthat every American enjoys, of course, is the right to complain.) In that \\nsense, too, the new immigrants are re-enacting the struggles of the generations \\nwho came before. The gritty truth-telling of \"New Americans\" only enhances its \\nimpact as a celebration of the enduring American dream. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Tutors were needed to work on a one-to-one basis \\nwith adults who wanted to improve their reading and writing skills. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'d never tried to teach anything before,\" Clements said. \"But after seeing \\nthe television program, I began to wonder what life would be like if I couldn\\'t \\nread. So I decided tutoring would be a worthwhile thing to try.\" \\n\\n\\nClements completed a 15-hour training session and in February was assigned to \\nwork with Jim, a warehouse supervisor who had never learned to read. \"He was \\n\\n\\nvery eager to make progress,\" Clements said. \"So we decided to meet at the \\nlibrary for two hours every Tuesday and Thursday night.\" \\n\\n\\nAt first, Jim could barely struggle through a book written at the third-grade \\nlevel. But after three months of steady improvement, he is taking on more \\ndifficult tasks, like reading newspapers and instruction manuals. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s fun to see how much difference it has made in his life,\" Clements said. \\n\"Tutoring takes a lot of time and patience, but I\\'ve gotten back 100% of \\n\\n\\nwhat I\\'ve put into it.\" \\n\\n\\nThe need for volunteer tutors increases every year, according to Marian Mosher \\nof the South Coast Literacy Council. \"Adult illiteracy has received a lot of \\nmedia attention recently, and people are less afraid to come forward for help,\" \\nshe said. \\n\\n\\nThe literacy problem is compounded in Orange County by the increasing number of \\nimmigrants arriving every year who need help learning English. According to the \\nImmigration and Naturalization Service, Orange County now ranks fourth \\n\\n\\nin the nation in the number of immigrants received every year. And the INS \\nestimate does not include those who live here illegally. \\n\\n\\n\"We have a mixture of ability levels among the recent immigrants. Many of them \\nhave highly developed skills in their native language, and when they come here \\nit\\'s frustrating not to be able to communicate. They are very motivated to \\nlearn English and qualify for a better job,\" Mosher said. \"Others have weak \\nskills in their own language, and that\\'s why individual tutoring works so well. \\nThe instruction is centered around the student\\'s rate of learning.\" \\n\\n\\nMosher has taught people from 17 different countries since becoming a tutor \\nfive years ago. \"I\\'ve made some lifetime friends. It\\'s very rewarding,\" she \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\nTutor training sessions are sponsored by the Orange County Public Library and \\nOrange County\\'s four volunteer literacy councils. The free workshops are held \\nyear-round in 75 locations throughout the county. Volunteer tutors receive free \\ninstructional materials and certification as a literacy trainer. Literacy \\ncouncils assist in matching students and teachers, who meet at mutually \\nconvenient times and locations. \\n\\n\\nHours: Hours vary, but most tutor training workshops are conducted during \\nevenings and on weekends. \\n\\n\\nAddress: Workshops are held in public libraries and selected sites throughout \\nOrange County.

            "{'text': '\\n\\nLanguage:  French \\nArticle Type:BFN \\n\\n [Article by Philippe Bernard: \"French Nationality -- A New \\nUser\\'s Guide\"] \\n  [Text] The implementing decree of the 22 July law reforming \\nthe law governing French nationality was published in the \\nJOURNAL OFFICIEL on Friday 31 December. It stipulates the \\nconditions under which the desire to become French will have to \\nbe expressed in the future by some children of immigrants. \\nAnother decree lays down the principle of the county courts and \\ndistrict courts specializing in the issue of nationality. \\nDespite government promises, no national information campaign on \\nthis sensitive subject has been planned. \\n  How can somebody become French? Starting from 1 January \\n1994, the question will acquire a new angle for the tens of \\nthousands of young people born in France of foreign parents. \\nThe start of the new year will also see the entry into force of \\nthe entire reform of the nationality laws adopted in June 1993 \\nafter bitter debates. One part of this text has been in force \\nsince last July. The decree, which has just been published \\nfollowing an opinion by the Council of State, was signed by the \\nprime minister and the five other ministers concerned: the \\nministers of justice, of the interior, of social affairs, \\ndefense, and overseas territories and departments [DOM-TOM]. It \\nprovides for specific new channels of access to French \\nnationality for the children of immigrants, which are decisive \\nfor their integration. \\n  What follows is the new user\\'s guide to gaining French \\nnationality, as laid down by the new decree. \\n  Four Places to Express One\\'s Desire To Be French \\n  Young people born in France of two foreign parents born \\nabroad must henceforth show their desire to acquire French \\nnationality. This requirement only affects persons who will be \\n18 years old after 1 January 1994. \\n  The new procedure applies between 16 and 21 years of age. \\nHowever, it is highly recommended to set things in motion \\nbetween the ages of 16 and 18, the period during which no \\nobstacle can be placed in the path of a young offender, whereas \\nafter the age of 18 certain criminal convictions will prevent \\nthe future acquisition of nationality. The procedure in \\nquestion is carried out simply and without any authorization \\nbeing required from the parents. \\n  The decree empowers four authorities to receive the \\nexpression of the desire to gain French nationality: civil \\nservants in all city halls (regardless of the place of residence \\nof the interested party); prefectorial departments (prefectures \\nand sub-prefectures); county judges; and the commanders of \\ngendarmerie brigades. The expression of this desire may be made \\nfreely in writing, but pre-printed application forms will be \\ndistributed in the relevant places and in schools. Educational \\nestablishments, as well as police stations, may not process \\napplications themselves. \\n  In the event, the four types of institution designated by \\nthe \\ndecree act merely as mailboxes. Whatever the circumstances, \\nthey are bound to receive the young persons involved and give \\nthem a dated official document attesting to their application. \\nThe institutions must then pass on the document to the county \\njudge within three days. In the event of a rejection, summary \\nproceedings may be launched for faulty processing. \\n  Although four authorities are competent to receive \\nexpressions of the desire for French nationality, only one may \\nrule on the matter: the specialized county court judge (of whom \\nthere are between two and four per department). This individual \\ndoes not have to rule on the appropriateness of the request, but \\nmust merely verify that the conditions laid down by the law have \\nall been met. To this end, the judge involved asks the \\napplicants to provide the following official documents: their \\nbirth certificate as proof of their birth in France; a \\ncertificate of nonpunishment or of penalties incurred [issued by \\nthe Ministry of Justice] (only for majors), and proof of their \\nhabitual residence in France during the five years preceding the \\nrequest. \\n  The latter proof may be provided in writing in any form: \\nschool certificates, receipts for rent or electricity payments, \\nfor example. The submission of these documents will be \\nofficially acknowledged by the county court judge, who will then \\nhave six months in which to submit his decision. Should the \\njudge fail to respond within this period, then the registration \\nof the nationality is considered to have been accepted. Once \\nthe desire for French nationality has been recorded, the young \\nperson in question may immediately obtain a certificate of \\nnationality and have an identity card issued. \\n  In the event of a negative decision on the part of the \\njudge, the interested party may summon the attorney general \\nbefore the district court to have their French status \\nrecognized. The same party may also launch a hierarchical \\nappeal against the judge\\'s ruling before the minister of \\njustice. The decree states, exceptionally, that any minor aged \\n16 may institute these proceedings without receiving any \\nauthorization from their parents. \\n  Limited Dual Nationality for Algerians \\n  The new law abolishes the benefit of dual nationality for \\nthe \\nchildren of persons born in former French colonies. By virtue \\nof this principle, which continued to apply until 31 December \\n1993, any child born in France of parents who were born in \\nformer French territories (excluding Algeria) were born French. \\n  The principle still applies if the parents were born in \\nAlgeria before that country gained its independence. However, a \\ncontested government amendment has introduced the requirement of \\nfive years of regular residence in France by the parents as at \\nthe time of the birth of their child. This provision -- which \\nbreaks politically with the theory according to which Algeria \\nwas a French department just like any other prior to 1962 -- \\nwill be the source of extreme administrative complications. In \\neffect, it will come down to requiring all the parents concerned \\nto provide documentary proof of five years of regular residence \\nin France. \\n  The danger is that proof of this kind, though relatively \\nsimple to provide at the time the child is born, could be \\nvirtually impossible to verify when most of the parents \\nconcerned are actually led to consider the question of the \\nnationality of their children at the age of adolescence, if not \\nwhen they come of age. Who will be able to prove, 18 years on, \\nthat they previously resided in France on a regular basis? For \\nthis reason, parents will be well advised to initiate \\nproceedings at the birth [of their child], demanding a \\ncertificate of nationality from the county court judge. \\n  Information in Schools and High Schools \\n  The extremely late publication of the decree has meant that \\nhardly any serious information could be circulated as yet. Some \\nrather unclear pamphlets have been distributed to the [relevant] \\nadministrations, but nobody seems to know for sure whether they \\nhave reached the people for whom they were intended. \\n  Whereas the law was adopted six months ago, the decree \\nproviding for an information mechanism is still not ready. When \\nit is, it will assign educational establishments, state national \\ninsurance offices, welfare centers, and territorial authorities \\na \"duty to provide information.\" It would also have to provide \\nfor the designation, in each school and high school of a \\n\"correspondent on matters of nationality\" who will serve as \\nmiddlemen between pupils of foreign origin and the \\nadministrations concerned. The decree will also provide for the \\nmodification of programs of civic education to include in them \\nsome notions on the acquisition of French nationality. Finally, \\na legal reference text should be distributed to the \\nadministrations, associations, and media. \\n  However, the \"major national information campaign\" promised \\nto members of parliament by Pierre Mehaignerie and Simone Veil \\nwill doubtless never take place. The fear is that, in the \\nabsence of information, young people will not take the steps \\nrequired to gain French nationality, or will allow the deadline \\nimposed by the law to pass. Radio broadcasts and televised \\nadvertisements should attenuate this risk. So far no financing \\nhas been freed up. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ENGLISH-ONLY MOVEMENT LEGITIMIZES ATTACKS ON BROTHERHOOD AND TOLERANCE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrotherhood and good will can be protected only by being alert to challenges to \\nthem. Some of the challenges -- like ethnic slurs, hate-filled graffiti and \\nracist violence -- are crude and obvious. Others are subtle but no less \\ndangerous. In particular, an ugly strain of prejudice against immigrants and \\nother \"foreigners\" has emerged in California, slickly packaged and with an \\ninnocent-sounding name: the official-English movement. \\n\\n\\nThis movement, more accurately called the English-only movement, wants to pass \\nlocal and federal laws making English our \"official\" language nationwide, as \\nProposition 63 did for California in 1986. The movement\\'s representatives argue \\nthat English is in danger of being displaced by other languages, especially \\nSpanish. The movement likes to paint itself as a moderate, common-sense effort \\nstriving only to promote national unity by preserving America\\'s \\nEnglish-language heritage. \\n\\n\\nThe English-under-siege argument is simply wrong. According to the 1980 census, \\n98% of American residents over 4 years old speak English \"well\" or \"very well.\" \\nA 1985 RAND Corp. study found that among first-generation Americans whose \\nmother tongue is Spanish, 90% are proficient in English and 50% of their \\nchildren can\\'t speak Spanish. \\n\\n\\nThe claim that the English-only movement was moderate and promoted national \\nunity could have appeared plausible until the passage of English-only laws at \\nthe state and local levels. But, in the aftermath of Proposition 63 and similar \\nmeasures elsewhere, it is clear that English-only policies only encourage \\nhostility toward immigrants and increase intolerance toward citizens, \\nespecially Asians and Latinos, whose first language is not English. \\n\\n\\nA continuing legal battle in Monterey Park is a case in point. In 1987 a slate \\nof candidates was elected to the Monterey Park City Council pledging to put \\nteeth into Proposition 63 at the local level. After taking office, some of the \\ncouncil members expressed concern over the number of non-English (mainly \\nChinese-language) books on the Monterey Park public library\\'s shelves, despite \\nthe fact that the books made up less than 10% of the library\\'s stock. In \\nOctober that year, the council dissolved the library\\'s independent board of \\ncommissioners and took control of library management. Although the council used \\n\"financial account-ability\" as a justification, its subsequent actions made \\nclear that its real motivation was contempt for the rights of language \\nminorities. \\n\\n\\nThe council slashed the library\\'s 1988-89 budget for foreign-language materials \\nfrom more than $11,000 to about $3,000. Mayor Barry L. Hatch was surprisingly \\nfrank about his view that the public library\\'s services should be extended only \\nto citizens able to read English. \"I don\\'t think we need to cater too much to \\nforeign languages,\" Hatch said. \"I think if people want a foreign language they \\ncan go purchase books on their own.\" \\n\\n\\nThis intolerant rights-for-some-but-not-for-others attitude outraged other \\nmembers of the Monterey Park community and led to a lawsuit filed by Monterey \\nPark citizens and civil-liberties groups in Superior Court. The suit seeks to \\nreinstate the library board as a way to ensure that the public library serves \\nall of Monterey Park\\'s citizens. \\n\\n\\nSimilar incidents have occurred in other cities, too. In Huntington Park, \\nmunicipal-court employees were forbidden to speak to each other in Spanish, but \\nthe U.S. 9th Circuit Court ruled the ban illegal. English-only supporter S. I. \\nHayakawa has said that Proposition 63 prohibits government workers even from \\ndiscussing their lunch plans in Spanish. At a hospitalin Los Angeles, the head \\nnurse forbade workers to speak any language but English and urged employees to \\nreport anyone who violated the ban. The manager of an insurance company ordered \\nemployees not to converse in Chinese unless they were dealing with a \\nChinese-speaking customer. \\n\\n\\nEnglish-only laws were adopted last November in Colorado, Arizona and Florida, \\nand are already being used to harass Latinos. In Miami a supermarket clerk was \\nsuspended after he spoke Spanish to another worker. When a woman called a \\ndepartment store to place an order and began speaking in Spanish, the clerk \\ncited the English-only law and hung up. In Grand Junction, Colo., a school-bus \\ndriver told a student that speaking Spanish was no longer allowed on board. \\n\\n\\nThe idea that laws like Proposition 63 are merely symbolic, or just common \\nsense, or only promote national unity, is a fantasy. The record of English-only \\nlegislation demonstrates that it legitimizes attacks on brotherhood and \\ntolerance, encouraging an ugly strain of bigotry that has no place in American \\nsociety. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

About 90% of foreign students speak Spanish, and \\nmost who speak other languages are scattered throughout the district and often \\nget special instruction. \\n\\n\\nBut there are nowhere near enough bilingual teachers and aides to go around, \\nforcing school principals to scrap traditional teaching plans and adopt \\napproaches such as team teaching and cooperative learning, which may have \\nstudents as young as first grade changing classrooms and teachers several times \\neach day. \\n\\n\\n\"Theoretically, all limited-English-proficient kids should be in classrooms \\nwhere someone speaks their language,\" said Michael Ginsik, an adviser in the \\ndistrict\\'s bilingual program. \"Realistically, they probably are not.\" \\n\\n\\nBilingual education -- the notion that children should learn in their native \\nlanguage before they tackle subjects in English -- has been passionately \\ndebated nationwide. \\n\\n\\nSteadfast Policy \\n\\n\\nThe Los Angeles district -- with about 170,000 of its nearly 600,000 students \\nspeaking little or no English -- has remained steadfast in its support for \\nbilingual education. \\n\\n\\nBut a burgeoning population of students who do not speak English, and a lack of \\nteachers and classrooms, threatens to accomplish what bilingual education\\'s \\nopponents have not been able to do -- force students to learn in English-only \\nclassrooms. \\n\\n\\nMost of the district\\'s bilingual teachers are assigned to schools in South and \\nEast Los Angeles, where most Spanish-speaking children reside. But because \\nschools in those areas are overcrowded, the district has \"capped\" many of them \\nand buses the overflow to schools on the Westside and in the San Fernando \\nValley. \\n\\n\\nOfficials had predicted that a large proportion of the district\\'s enrollment \\ngrowth this year would be among non-English-speaking students as immigrants \\ncontinue to flock to the central city. But the problem has been finding \\nclassroom space for the new students, while maintaining racial balance and \\nminimizing travel time on buses in the sprawling 500-school district. \\n\\n\\nOfficials hope a new $5,000 annual pay bonus will attract more bilingual \\nteachers. But for now, many schools are forced to rely largely on bilingual \\naides -- primarily college students who work three hours each day with groups \\nof non-English-speaking students. \\n\\n\\nSchools which receive bused-in students are given money by the district to hire \\none aide for every 30 students they receive, but finding the aides has proved \\nto be a challenge for some schools. \\n\\n\\n\"When you\\'re at a school like this, where there\\'s no resident Spanish-speaking \\npopulation and it\\'s far away from any college with (an education) program, it\\'s \\nhard to attract aides,\" said Pacific Palisades Principal Arnold, who has six \\naides for 10 bilingual classrooms. \\n\\n\\n\"Who wants to travel way out here and back for a three hour-a-day job?\" she \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\nTo cope with the shortage, many principals move their aides around to cover \\nmore than one classroom -- but that still leaves many Spanish-speaking children \\nalone in classes with English-speaking teachers for much of the day. \\n\\n\\nExcept for the 40 minutes each day that Blackwell-Brown has a bilingual aide in \\nher classroom, she tries to make do with the smattering of \"street Spanish\" she \\npicked up teaching in East Los Angeles years ago. \\n\\n\\n\"Sometimes the kids just sit there . . . you know they\\'re not getting anything. \\nYou feel so guilty, but your back is against the wall. What can you do?\" \\n\\n\\nSome overburdened schools try to maximize use of teachers and aides with \\nconcepts spelled out in the district\\'s master plan for bilingual education. But \\nthose non-traditional approaches have spawned some opposition from teachers and \\nparents. \\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got teachers who\\'ve been here for years and done a wonderful job and \\nsuddenly they\\'ve got these children they can\\'t reach,\" said Charlotte McKinney, \\nhead of a district task force dealing with bilingual education. \"It\\'s very \\nfrustrating. \\n\\n\\n\"The way it used to be -- the self-contained classroom with one teacher where \\nthe kids get to know each other and stay together -- that\\'s a wonderful model, \\nbut it doesn\\'t work in this district anymore.\" \\n\\n\\nThe district is sponsoring training sessions to teach principals and teachers \\nconcepts such as team teaching -- where two or three bilingual classrooms are \\ncombined, with a bilingual teacher and a teacher who only speaks English -- and \\ncooperative learning groups, where children work with other children, in effect \\ntutoring their peers. \\n\\n\\nThose approaches have incensed some English-speaking parents who feel that \\ntheir children are being shortchanged. \\n\\n\\nStudents as Tutors \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re living in an area where there are a lot of housekeepers, so some of our \\nkids have picked up a little Spanish,\" said the mother of a Wilbur student, who \\nasked not to be identified. \\n\\n\\n\"Now my daughter\\'s time is spent tutoring the Spanish-speaking kids because the \\nattitude of the teachers is they can\\'t help the kids.

He and the teachers have \\nbeen so preoccupied with the logistics of accommodating the new students, \"we \\nhaven\\'t really had a chance to worry about things like what reading groups (the \\nSpanish-speakers) should be in. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s meant changes for a lot of our kids, but some schools had it worse,\" he \\nsaid. \"I know some principals who had to reorganize four or five times.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHILDREN LAP UP FOREIGN TONGUES; \\n\\n\\nEDUCATION: ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN IRVINE ARE LEARNING FOREIGN LANGUAGES \\nIN AFTER-SCHOOL CLASSES. ORGANIZERS HOPE THE CLASSES WILL BECOME PART OF THE \\nCURRICULUM. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSixth-grader Joey Stice, blond and freckle-faced, scrunches up his nose and \\nfrowns, wondering what to do with the colored construction paper in front of \\nhim. \\n\\n\\nHis teacher, Kate Halpin, has issued simple enough instructions: \"Couvrez vos \\noreilles avec du papier bleu.\" \\n\\n\\nKartheek Nagappala, sitting across from Joey, immediately puts a sheet of blue \\npaper over his ears, as do some of the other children who have caught on. Joey \\nfinally gets it and covers his ears, too. \\n\\n\\nThe pupils, some as young as 8, are in Halpin\\'s after-school French class at \\nIrvine\\'s Brywood Elementary School. For an entire hour, they listen intently as \\nred-headed Halpin runs about the classroom animatedly, asking her young charges \\nto point to the clock, to hold up a yellow paper, to count to 20, to draw a red \\nball or to name the days of the week -- all in French. \\n\\n\\n\"Magnifique!\" she says in approval. \"C\\'est bon! C\\'est bon!\" \\n\\n\\nWhile other children might have gone straight from school to soccer practice, \\npiano lessons or Boy Scout meetings, 289 young children in the Irvine Unified \\nSchool District spent two afternoons a week last semester in classes such as \\nHalpin\\'s, learning another language. They are part of a growing trend in \\nschools throughout the country to teach children as young as kindergarten age a \\nforeign language. \\n\\n\\nFrom Culver City to Detroit, parents and educators are recognizing that if \\nAmerica is to stay competitive in the world market, the ability to speak only \\nEnglish is no longer good enough. \\n\\n\\nThe language classes are not required fare in Irvine. In fact, the idea to \\noffer the courses is entirely parent-driven and parent-funded. The district, \\nhowever, has allowed the organizing group to offer the classes at 17 school \\ncampuses, most of the time using instructors who teach the language courses at \\narea high schools. \\n\\n\\nThe hope, says Cindy Peronto, one of the parent-organizers, is that eventually \\nthe district will provide funding and help disprove a saying well-known in \\nforeign language instruction circles: A trilingual person is someone who speaks \\nthree languages. A bilingual person speaks two languages. A monolingual person \\nis an American. \\n\\n\\n\"We Americans are so behind the times,\" Peronto said. \"It\\'s foolish to think we \\ncan keep being a monolingual society if we want to compete in this world.\" \\n\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the second session of Irvine\\'s pilot program gets under way. \\nPeronto says enthusiasm for the courses has been so high that this time around \\nRussian and Japanese are being added to a list of offerings that already \\nincludes Spanish, French, German, Latin and Chinese. The program also will \\noffer a class in sign language. \\n\\n\\n\"We can\\'t wait until high school before we begin to teach children foreign \\nlanguages,\" she said. \"It\\'s amazing how fast these little ones learn and how \\neager they are to try to speak another language.\" \\n\\n\\nFor many of the children, some who have never had foreign language instruction, \\nthe lessons are mind-boggling. But in Halpin\\'s class, pupils as young as third \\ngrade said they would rather spend their time learning to pronounce the nasal \\nsounds of the French language than be somewhere else. \\n\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s important to speak another language, especially Spanish, because \\nthere are so many Spanish-speaking people here,\" said Megan Crowley, a \\nsixth-grader in Halpin\\'s class. \"French is another language I want to learn, \\nand it\\'s fun.\" \\n\\n\\nThe only time Halpin speaks to her pupils in English is at the beginning of the \\nclass, when she tells them to stand up and stretch to get rid of the day\\'s \\nweariness before they launch into the intense hour of foreign language \\ninstruction. \\n\\n\\n\"OK, have we got our yah-yahs out now?\" she asks them. \\n\\n\\nMost of the children in this class are sixth-graders, but the program allows \\nfor participants of any age. Some of Halpin\\'s pupils have studied foreign \\nlanguages before, especially those who have recently moved to the area from \\nschool districts outside of California. \\n\\n\\n\"We were so disappointed when we moved here from Chicago that the public \\nschools don\\'t offer foreign language in the elementary grades,\" said Vicki \\nChen, whose 8-year-old daughter, Ellen, is in Halpin\\'s class. \"In Chicago \\nschools, it was compulsory. \\n\\n\\n\"After the age of 15, they say your tongue starts to be a little less \\nflexible,\" she said. \"I think the world is getting so small because of \\ntransportation advances and the media, that I want my children to take \\nadvantage of the cultural opportunities available to them.\" \\n\\n\\nHer other daughter, Nicole, 11, has taken three years of German. \"When we went \\nto Europe, she translated for us,\" Chen said. \\n\\n\\nAt the state level, the push for foreign language instruction is also receiving \\nmore attention. Last year, State Supt. of Schools Bill Honig published the \\nForeign Language Framework for kindergarten through 12th grade, which guides \\nschool districts toward more and earlier instruction. The aim is to make \\nforeign language classes a state requirement at the elementary level. \\n\\n\\nAs California becomes more economically competitive with Pacific Rim and \\nEuropean nations, Honig said, \"proficiency in another language is no longer a \\nluxury, but a necessity.\" \\n\\n\\nForeign language is not being provided as part of the curriculum in the lower \\ngrades at any other Orange County school, so Irvine would be the first if \\nparents can persuade board members that it is worth the time and effort. \\n\\n\\nA group of parents in the Tustin Unified School District has been sponsoring a \\nsimilar but much smaller after-school program for more than 20 years, but the \\ndistrict has not made the courses part of the curriculum. \\n\\n\\nAt Brywood, Principal Stu Cunningham said Irvine\\'s changing student population \\nhas magnified the need for multilingual instruction. \\n\\n\\n\"Irvine is very much a salad bowl in terms of students from around the world,\" \\nhe said. \"There are 57 different languages spoken in our district. There is a \\nreal need to make students aware of other languages spoken in our own community \\nas well as to give them an entree to their careers later on.\" \\n\\n\\nCunningham would like to see the program move into the school\\'s curriculum. \\n\"You can always make time in the school day to add another program,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nFor parents who worry that foreign language classes will get in the way of \\nother subjects, there is a multitude of examples of districts throughout the \\nstate that have made a solid commitment to teaching children a foreign language \\nwhile still maintaining academic achievement in other areas. \\n\\n\\nThe Culver City school district has one of the oldest foreign language \\nimmersion programs in the country. Kindergarten pupils and first-graders in \\nparticipating schools are taught entirely in Spanish and continue to receive a \\nfew hours of Spanish a day throughout the rest of their elementary school \\ninstruction. \\n\\n\\nMadeline Ehrlich, founder of Advocates for Foreign Language Learning, the \\nparent support group in Culver City, said her district\\'s program has helped \\nturn out children fluent in both English and Spanish and who do well \\nacademically. \\n\\n\\nShe said the program was controversial when it was started in 1971 because \\nparents feared that children would fall behind in other subjects. But that fear \\nhas been largely overcome in her district, and she says it can happen in other \\nschools, too. \\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s plenty of research that shows that if you\\'re educated in English, you \\nwill be educated in Spanish, or another language,\" she said. \"You only learn to \\nread once. If you\\'re a good reader in English, you will be a good reader in \\nanother language. If you\\'re intelligent in Italian, you\\'re intelligent in \\nEnglish.\" \\n\\n\\nShe said 47 school systems throughout the country offer immersion, or partial \\nimmersion programs for foreign language instruction. She called programs such \\nas Irvine\\'s, that offer only after-school and parent-funded programs, \\n\"half-baked.\" \\n\\n\\n\"You do not learn a foreign language by studying it 20 minutes a day,\" she \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\nPeronto agrees with Erhlich that for the language classes to succeed, the \\ndistrict must show a commitment. But she says it has to begin with parent \\nsupport. \\n\\n\\n\"I want to see it taught during school too,\" she said. \"But my hope is that by \\nhaving it after school first, the desire in the community will become so \\nstrong, and then parents will cry out and say, \\'let\\'s put some money into it.\\' \\n\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJune 18, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSOME LATINO PARENTS PREFER ENGLISH, SHUN BILINGUAL PROGRAMS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYolanda Granados knows that Southern California employers value workers who \\nspeak both English and Spanish. So she wants her son, Luis, to grow up \\nbilingual. \\n\\n\\nBut when Luis started kindergarten last fall at Glenwood School in Sun Valley, \\nmost of the instruction he received was in Spanish. Granados worried that, as a \\nresult, he would fall behind in English. She asked school officials to change \\nher son\\'s classroom assignment. \\n\\n\\nMany Latino parents are surprised when they find out that much, and in some \\ncases most, of the instruction in a bilingual classroom is in Spanish, said \\nGloria Soto, a parent activist at Glenwood. But, she said, school officials \\ndiscourage such parents from requesting a change to a classroom where English \\npredominates. \\n\\n\\n\"Parents . . . ask what they can do if they don\\'t want their child in the \\nbilingual program,\" Soto said. \"I tell them that if they don\\'t want their child \\nin the program, then sign them out.\" \\n\\n\\nIn April, Soto organized a group of Glenwood parents to march at the school in \\nsupport of Sally Peterson, the Glenwood kindergarten teacher who founded the \\ngroup Learning English Advocates Drive. LEAD members argue that teaching in \\nEnglish, with assistance from an aide fluent in the students\\' native language, \\nhastens their progress in speaking English. \\n\\n\\nBut the Los Angeles Unified School District\\'s master plan for bilingual \\neducation is built on the principle that students are best taught in their \\nnative language, with daily doses of English instruction. When students able to \\nread and write in their native language become fluent in English, those skills \\neasily transfer to the new language, the district maintains. \\n\\n\\nState and federal laws require that parents be allowed to choose from the \\ndifferent language approaches. At Glenwood -- as at many schools -- the \\nparents\\' right to choose has become something of a tug-of-war between \\neducators. \\n\\n\\n\"They brainwash parents,\" said Linda Meier, coordinator of the school\\'s \\nbilingual program, referring to Peterson and the other three Glenwood teachers \\naffiliated with LEAD. \"They literally tell the parents that the reason their \\nchildren cannot read is because of the bilingual program, and this is not \\ntrue.\" \\n\\n\\nBut Peterson said Meier and other school district officials attempt to coerce \\nparents into keeping their children in bilingual classes. At some schools, she \\nsaid, a videotape is shown in which happy children are speaking Spanish and \\ntearful children are speaking English. \"This kind of harassment and duress is \\nan insult to parents,\" Peterson said. \\n\\n\\nWhen they start school, students with Hispanic surnames are tested to determine \\nwhether they are fluent in English. But the tests are so flawed that many who \\ndo not need bilingual instruction -- including some born in the United States, \\nwhose parents do not speak Spanish -- are put in the classes, Peterson said. \\n\\n\\nMeier denied that parents are coerced. \"I would never do that to a parent \\nbecause it\\'s not my child,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nMeier and Peterson agreed, however, that Latino culture causes many parents to \\nbe deferential to teachers, making the parents vulnerable to manipulation. \\n\\n\\nAbout 500 of Glenwood\\'s 800 students speak limited English. Meier said about \\n100 of these students, including all of those in Peterson\\'s kindergarten class, \\nhave been assigned at their parents\\' request to \"individual learning plans,\" \\nwhere children are taught in English. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndividual Learning Plans \\n\\n\\nDistrictwide, 22% of the 120,000 limited-English-speaking elementary school \\nstudents are assigned to individual learning plans. But only 13% of those \\nstudents participate in the plans at their parents\\' request. The other 9% are \\nassigned to the programs because bilingual classes are unavailable at their \\nschools. \\n\\n\\nGranados, a former executive secretary, said it took several telephone calls, \\nseveral visits to the school and a meeting with the coordinator of Glenwood\\'s \\nbilingual program to get her son\\'s classroom assignment changed. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mind my kid learning Spanish,\" Granados said, but not at the expense \\nof learning in English. She speaks mostly Spanish to Luis, and her husband, \\nLuis Sr., speaks English to him. \\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s Latino, but he was born in this state,\" she said of her son. \"I want him \\nlearning the language that is going to help him in this state.\" \\n\\n\\nMeier said that since LEAD\\'s founding, many parents have asked to remove their \\nchildren from the bilingual program. \"I had to insist that these parents get \\nproperly informed\" about the program, she said. \"Some of the stories they come \\nin with, I can see that they are totally confused.\" \\n\\n\\nPeterson, however, complained that Meier\\'s counseling about the language \\ninstruction options has been one-sided. As a result, Peterson is the only \\nteacher at the school allowed to counsel parents about where their students are \\nplaced. \\n\\n\\nMaria Dominguez, whose son Mariano is a student in Peterson\\'s class, speaks \\nonly Spanish. But Dominguez said through a translator that she wants her son to \\nbe taught in English. She said she was asked about placing him in a bilingual \\nclass, but refused. \\n\\n\\n\"I like it the way it is,\" she said. \"He\\'s happy, and he\\'s learning very fast.\" \\n\\n\\nSoto, who did not learn Spanish in school but picked it up later, said she and \\nthe other parents in her group think that bilingual education is necessary for \\nstudents who speak no English. But such students should be quickly moved into \\nclasses taught in English, she said. \\n\\n\\n\"The administration truly believes that what they\\'re trying to do is best,\" \\nSoto said. \"But I would like them to come to individual schools and talk to \\nparents and see what the parents want.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

But on Friday, the 16-year-old stood before a crowd of \\nparents, peers and others and sang the opening lines of a Brazilian folk song \\n-- in Portuguese. \\n\\n\\nIt was only fitting. \\n\\n\\nIn an auditorium festooned with balloons, 220 students from a dozen countries \\n-- most of whom had arrived in the United States only a few months ago -- \\ncelebrated the end of their first session at the Newcomer Center. The center, \\nlocated at Crenshaw High School in Southwest Los Angeles, is a special Los \\nAngeles Unified School District program to help newly arrived immigrants adjust \\nto the U.S. education system. \\n\\n\\nThe master of ceremonies was from El Salvador, the pianist from Nicaragua and \\nthe choir from Vietnam, China and Mexico, among other places. Some students \\nperformed humorous skits to show off their newly acquired English, such as one \\nabout eating in a restaurant and finding a fly in the soup. One group of \\nChinese students offered a stirring dance symbolizing the struggle for \\ndemocracy in their homeland. \\n\\n\\n\"A lot of these kids are from troubled countries,\" teacher Guillermo Pasillas \\nsaid, \"yet they\\'re able to forget about that here. I see a lot of enthusiasm \\nand a lot of respect for education. They\\'ve been great to work with.\" \\n\\n\\nOpen since July 3, the Newcomer Center is one of two special schools for \\nimmigrants to be opened this year by the school district. The Crenshaw High \\ncenter, which started with a six-week summer session, will enroll up to 450 \\nhigh school students in the fall for a yearlong program to help prepare them \\nfor regular high school classes. \\n\\n\\nInstruction will be delivered in the students\\' native language for mathematics, \\nlanguage arts and U.S. history and culture. They also will receive intensive \\nEnglish instruction and physical education. \\n\\n\\nAbout 200 elementary pupils are expected at a second Newcomer Center opening \\nnext week on the site of the former Bellagio Road School in Bel-Air. \\n\\n\\nThe schools were the brainchild of former Board of Education member Alan \\nGershman, who proposed the program two years ago because he believed that the \\ndistrict needed to do more to ensure the success of the thousands of immigrant \\nstudents entering its schools. \\n\\n\\n\"They were dropping out in huge numbers,\" said Maria Olmos, who directs the \\nCrenshaw center, \"and we wanted to make sure that they would continue on in \\nschool.\" \\n\\n\\nMost of the newcomer students live near downtown Los Angeles and have taken a \\ndistrict bus to Crenshaw each day, Olmos said. More than 80% of the students \\nare natives of El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala. But others are from Hong \\nKong, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand. \\n\\n\\nAlthough most of the students emigrated with their families, about 10 left \\ntheir country without kin and are supporting themselves, according to school \\npsychologist Brad Pilon. \\n\\n\\nSome, like 17-year-old Rosa Saucedo from Mexico, said they find the U.S. \\neducation system confusing and more difficult than schools back home. But \\nothers, such as Ambi Bangis, 15, from the Philippines and Bussarin Kiewkram, \\n15, from Thailand, said they find the classes much easier. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t have to study,\" Ambi said. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJune 29, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPARENTS CAUGHT IN TUG OF WAR OVER BILINGUAL SCHOOLING \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYolanda Granados knows that Southern California employers value workers who \\nspeak both English and Spanish. So she wants her son, Luis, to grow up \\nbilingual. \\n\\n\\nBut when Luis started kindergarten last fall at Glenwood School in Sun Valley, \\nmost of the instruction he received was in Spanish. Granados worried that, as a \\nresult, he would fall behind in English. She asked school officials to change \\nher son\\'s classroom assignment. \\n\\n\\nMany Latino parents are surprised when they find out that much, and in some \\ncases most, of the instruction in a bilingual classroom is in Spanish, said \\nGloria Soto, a parent activist at Glenwood. But, she said, school officials \\ndiscourage such parents from requesting a change to a classroom where English \\npredominates. \\n\\n\\n\"Parents . . . ask what they can do if they don\\'t want their child in the \\nbilingual program,\" Soto said. \"I tell them that if they don\\'t want their child \\nin the program, then sign them out.\" \\n\\n\\nIn April, Soto organized a group of Glenwood parents to march at the school in \\nsupport of Sally Peterson, the Glenwood kindergarten teacher who founded the \\ngroup Learning English Advocates Drive. LEAD members argue that teaching in \\nEnglish, with assistance from an aide fluent in the students\\' native language, \\nhastens their progress in speaking English. \\n\\n\\nBut the Los Angeles Unified School District\\'s master plan for bilingual \\neducation is built on the principle that students are best taught in their \\nnative language, with daily doses of English instruction. When students able to \\nread and write in their native language become fluent in English, those skills \\neasily transfer to the new language, the district maintains. \\n\\n\\nState and federal laws require that parents be allowed to choose from the \\ndifferent language approaches. At Glenwood -- as at many schools -- the \\nparents\\' right to choose has become something of a tug of war between \\neducators. \\n\\n\\n\"They brainwash parents,\" said Linda Meier, coordinator of the school\\'s \\nbilingual program, referring to Peterson and the other three Glenwood teachers \\naffiliated with LEAD. \"They literally tell the parents that the reason their \\nchildren cannot read is because of the bilingual program, and this is not \\ntrue.\" \\n\\n\\nBut Peterson said Meier and other school district officials attempt to coerce \\nparents into keeping their children in bilingual classes. At some schools, she \\nsaid, a videotape is shown in which happy children are speaking Spanish and \\ntearful children are speaking English. \"This kind of harassment and duress is \\nan insult to parents,\" Peterson said. \\n\\n\\nWhen they start school, students with Hispanic surnames are tested to determine \\nwhether they are fluent in English. But the tests are so flawed that many who \\ndo not need bilingual instruction -- including some born in the United States, \\nwhose parents do not speak Spanish -- are put in the classes, Peterson said. \\n\\n\\nMeier denied that parents are coerced. \"I would never do that to a parent \\nbecause it\\'s not my child,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nMeier and Peterson agreed, however, that Latino culture causes many parents to \\nbe deferential to teachers, making the parents vulnerable to manipulation. \\n\\n\\nAbout 500 of Glenwood\\'s 800 students speak limited English. Meier said about \\n100 of these students, including all of those in Peterson\\'s kindergarten class, \\nhave been assigned at their parents\\' request to \"individual learning plans,\" \\nwhere children are taught in English. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndividual Learning Plans \\n\\n\\nDistrictwide, 22% of the 120,000 limited-English-speaking elementary school \\nstudents are assigned to individual learning plans. But only 13% of those \\nstudents participate in the plans at their parents\\' request. The other 9% are \\nassigned to the programs because bilingual classes are unavailable at their \\nschools. \\n\\n\\nGranados, a former executive secretary, said it took several telephone calls, \\nseveral visits to the school and a meeting with the coordinator of Glenwood\\'s \\nbilingual program to get her son\\'s classroom assignment changed. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mind my kid learning Spanish,\" Granados said, but not at the expense \\nof learning in English. She speaks mostly Spanish to Luis, and her husband, \\nLuis Sr., speaks English to him. \\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s Latino, but he was born in this state,\" she said of her son. \"I want him \\nlearning the language that is going to help him in this state.\" \\n\\n\\nMeier said that since LEAD\\'s founding, many parents have asked to remove their \\nchildren from the bilingual program. \"I had to insist that these parents get \\nproperly informed\" about the program, she said. \"Some of the stories they come \\nin with, I can see that they are totally confused.\" \\n\\n\\nPeterson, however, complained that Meier\\'s counseling about the language \\ninstruction options has been one-sided. As a result, Peterson is the only \\nteacher at the school allowed to counsel parents about where their students are \\nplaced. \\n\\n\\nMaria Dominguez, whose son Mariano is a student in Peterson\\'s class, speaks \\nonly Spanish.

Not only does LEAD recommend that the native tongue of non-English \\nspeaking children be used to clarify difficult new words and concepts, whenever \\npossible and appropriate, as English is being learned, it actively promotes \\nforeign language study for monolingual English-speaking students. \\n\\n\\nMoreover, no officer of LEAD ever made the statements Acuna attributed to it. \\nFor what it\\'s worth, I am bilingual, and I never learned a second language by \\nbeing taught exclusively in English. \\n\\n\\nAcuna neglects to mention national surveys which indicate that 80% of Latino \\nparents of limited-English speaking children believe bilingual program emphasis \\nshould be placed on teaching English. \\n\\n\\nThe days of sink-or-swim can never be allowed to return, but neither should \\nLatino children be abandoned in an institutionalized underclass simply because \\nof an inability to communicate effectively in English upon entering the \\nAmerican public education system.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nDecember 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPARENTS TOLERATE AMERICANIZATION; CHILDREN GAIN RESPECT FOR HERITAGE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter 21 years of living in America, Shih-how and Jane Chang have witnessed the \\nslow but unmistakable Americanization of their three daughters. \\n\\n\\nNo matter how often they speak Chinese to them, no matter how many stories of \\ntheir families and the \"old country\" they pass on, no matter how many Chinese \\nclasses are given, the parents see in their own daughters the gradual loss of a \\ngreat heritage. \\n\\n\\nIt isn\\'t that the Changs didn\\'t expect this to happen. It is the rapidity and \\nthoroughness of their daughters\\' Americanization that amazes them. \\n\\n\\nAnd recently, as if to underscore the reach of assimilation in their family, \\ntheir eldest daughter married a Caucasian. \\n\\n\\nBut the parents, immigrants from Taiwan who became U.S. citizens more than a \\ndecade ago, had long ago made their choice. \\n\\n\\n\"America is our home. If you do your best here, you have more opportunities. \\nOur children will have them too. But we know there will be cultural adjustments \\ntoo,\" said Shih-how, 54, an American-educated engineer and the current \\nprincipal of the parent-run Irvine Chinese School. \\n\\n\\nAs he spoke, his serious, bespectacled demeanor and carefully worded English \\nseemed to fit the stereotype of Chinese in America. Yet both parents\\' naturally \\nvibrant personalities can surface quickly, even among strangers, especially \\nwhen the Changs slip back into speaking Mandarin. \\n\\n\\nBut the subject this evening at their Irvine home was a particularly crucial \\none, and Jane Chang, 53, also confronted this matter of assimilation solemnly. \\n\\n\\n\"Yes, I worry a lot about it,\" she said in still halting English. \"Yes, it \\nmakes me sad when the culture goes, the language goes. When young people look \\nlike a Chinese, but don\\'t speak or think Chinese, it is very sad.\" \\n\\n\\nIt may be that assimilation, at least in the case of the Chang daughters, \\nhasn\\'t been that thorough. \\n\\n\\nConsider this from 25-year-old Sherry Jystad, whose vivacity and restless \\ncuriosity -- like her sisters Julie, 20, and Karen, 16 -- is as much Chinese as \\nit is American. \\n\\n\\n\"Now we realize that we\\'re a lot more Chinese than we thought,\" said Sherry, a \\nUC Irvine-educated computer programmer. \"This surprises us because -- living \\nhere in Orange County -- most of our friends and the things we do are \\nnon-Chinese.\" \\n\\n\\nMaybe, she suggested, something of what they were taught by their parents and \\nat the Irvine Chinese School has rubbed off. (The girls first attended in 1980 \\nwhen they moved to Irvine after living in San Diego, New Orleans and Wichita, \\nKan.) \\n\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s because of the trendiness of books, films and plays by \\nAsian-Americans -- whose works provide a cathartic experience for children of \\nChinese immigrants, especially the widely noted stories of Maxine Hong Kingston \\nand Amy Tan. \\n\\n\\nAnd maybe it\\'s the overall experience of simply growing up, and, added Julie, \\nan engineering major at UC Irvine, \"seeing some things a lot clearer and \\ngaining more understanding of your parents.\" \\n\\n\\nYet, said Julie, who studied Chinese culture in Taiwan last year in a summer \\ninstitute for American-born Chinese, \"We really don\\'t have to define just how \\nwe discovered it (Chinese identity). As long as we know it\\'s a part of us that \\nwe now recognize and treasure.\" \\n\\n\\nThis was not always so apparent. \\n\\n\\nLike most children at the Irvine Chinese School, the Chang girls had intensely \\ndisliked the whole idea of ethnic schools, and not just because it meant extra \\nschool and extra homework. \\n\\n\\n\"We kept thinking: Why are we going to these classes? The reasons seemed so \\nobscure to us,\" said Julie, who first attended the cultural and Mandarin \\nlanguage classes at age 11. \"To us it was just to please our parents, because \\nthey told us to do it.\" \\n\\n\\nIndeed, the classes seemed one more traditional duty to fulfill for the parents \\n-- most of whom, like Shih-how and Jane Chang, were born on the Chinese \\nmainland -- and who demanded obedience, familial responsibilities and school \\nachievement in the strictest sense. \\n\\n\\nBut the classes also made many children feel even more racially apart. They \\nfelt embarrassed whenever speaking Chinese outside the home or whenever their \\nparents behaved in a stereotypical \"Chinese\" manner. They felt profoundly \\nlacking in the kinds of independence and spontaneity that their Caucasian \\nfriends took for granted. \\n\\n\\nAnd, in the classic conflicts so detailed in contemporary Asian-American \\nliterature, the children felt lost in a bicultural chasm. \\n\\n\\n\"You felt like in a void. Our parents were expecting us to be good Chinese,\" \\nSherry said. \"The (American) schools were teaching us to be good Americans.\" \\n\\n\\nYet, their Chinese-ness has slowly begun to surface. \"For me, it was the \\nliterature. Reading works like (Amy Tan\\'s) \\'The Joy Luck Club,\\' \" Sherry \\nexplained. \"I saw our families, particularly our mothers, come to life in those \\nstories (about immigrant mothers and American-raised daughters). I laughed -- \\nand cried -- throughout that book.\" \\n\\n\\nFor Julie, who was also moved by the Tan stories, her sense of ethnic \\nliberation came in that trip last year to Taiwan (which she took only at her \\nparents\\' insistence). \\n\\n\\n\"I met hundreds of (American-born Chinese) students like myself -- confused, a \\nlittle like lost souls,\" Julie recalled. \"It was a revelation. We all had the \\nsame kind of families. We felt a special closeness, like finding what our \\nparents had been saying all along.\" \\n\\n\\nIf the daughters have changed -- so, too, apparently, have the Chang parents. \\n\\n\\n\"They have adapted terrifically well, we think,\" said the youngest, Karen. \"Oh \\nsure, they\\'re still very traditional. But they have accepted change, like \\ngiving us more say-so, more independence.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd they have even tolerated marriage to a non-Chinese. \\n\\n\\nAlthough Shih-how and Jane Chang, like most Chinese immigrant parents, still \\nstrongly prefer that their children marry only Chinese, they have shown \\nacceptance of Sherry\\'s marriage to Glenn Jystad. \\n\\n\\nSherry and Glenn, also 25 and a computer programmer, had met five years earlier \\nat UC Irvine. \\n\\n\\n\"My feeling is that if they are happy, if they get along and like each other, \\nit does not matter what the color is,\" Shih-how said. \\n\\n\\nJane, who had been the most outspoken about the marriage, described it this \\nway: \"I like Glenn.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWELCOMING IMMIGRANTS AND ENTERTAINING ANGELS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImmigration is a big story unfolding in the neighborhoods and parishes of our \\nArchdiocese of Los Angeles: It changes the face of the country and speaks of \\nthe vitality of American society. \\n\\n\\nOn balance, the experience of our history and the conclusion of experts find \\nthat a positive contribution is made by immigrants even today. Uneasiness, \\nhowever, surfaces on occasion perhaps due to fear of unknown cultural groups, \\nand of the possibility that asylum seekers, refugees and the poor may limit our \\ncomfort and remind us that we are not alone in an increasingly interdependent \\nworld. \\n\\n\\nIn the public-policy debate, specific signs of anxiety are frequently headlined \\nin the media and a concern emerges which calls for a thoughtful and cooperative \\nsearch for fair solutions to a number of issues. \\n\\n\\n -- Large numbers of individuals and families are without documents for legal \\nresidence in this country. Pushed out of their countries by violence and \\nhunger, they are unable to return home and yet have not benefitted from \\nlegalization provisions of the immigration law. More vulnerable than ever, this \\nsubclass of the poor cannot be written off without serious social and moral \\ncosts to their -- and our -- human dignity. \\n\\n\\n -- Surveys of implementation of current immigration laws find widespread \\ndiscrimination against legalized aliens and American citizens who appear \\nforeign, a situation worsened by lack of information on the exact provisions of \\nthe law. \\n\\n\\n -- Undercurrents of ethnic and religious prejudice exist in the push for \\n\"English only\" as the official language for public services and programs. Yet \\nour experience in the archdiocese shows that hundreds of thousands of newcomers \\nare most anxious to learn English. They come to classes day and night in our \\nparishes since they realize how essential it is to know our country\\'s language. \\n\\n\\n -- In an effort to cap immigration, little attention or priority is being \\ngiven to family unity and family reunification. An immigration legislation \\nreform that does not respect this basic American tradition would be a step \\nbackward. \\n\\n\\n -- The thousands of undocumented immigrants who received amnesty under the \\n1986 immigration law need support in meeting the education and documentation \\nrequirements of the law: English and civic classes, access to legal services \\nand timely information are essential. \\n\\n\\n -- In many corners of the world, refugee camps still overflow with people \\nhoping for return to a more peaceful homeland or for acceptance in a new land; \\ntheir plight and their voices reach out to all of us. \\n\\n\\nThese complex human, social and political issues confront the community of \\nfaith as it reflects on Jesus\\' message of reconciliation and on its \\nrelationship with Him. This relationship makes the church a sacrament of unity \\nfor the entire human family. \\n\\n\\nAs Pope John Paul II said in a recent encyclical letter, \"Solidarity helps us \\nto see the \\'other\\' -- whether a person or nation -- not just as some kind of \\ninstrument, with a work capacity and physical strength to be exploited at low \\ncost and then discarded when no longer useful, but as our \\'neighbor,\\' a \\n\\'helper,\\' to be made a sharer on par with ourselves in the banquet of life to \\nwhich all are equally invited by God.\" \\n\\n\\nA protagonist, therefore, in the immigration debate, the Catholic Church \\nfollows the example of Christ and welcomes all newcomers -- not just for the \\neconomic contribution they make through their work -- but because they add an \\nelement of social enhancement. \\n\\n\\nThe church sees in all immigrants, refugees and displaced persons an \\navant-garde that builds a world family and, often through pain, witnesses the \\ninterdependence of the contemporary world. Surely immigrants arrive among us \\nwith their needs but they also bear gifts of energy, resourcefulness and hope \\nthat contribute to the renewal of both society and the church. \\n\\n\\nIn a complex world, the encounter with newcomers reminds us of a simple fact: \\nWe are all brothers and sisters, one family. In this way, isolation and \\nhostility are impractical and misdirected attitudes. \\n\\n\\nLay men and women, pastors and religious, natives and immigrants are called and \\nempowered to heal the breaches in human solidarity. In fact, we are all \\ninstruments through whom God\\'s work of creation, redemption and sanctification \\nis brought together on earth. His plan is for a world family where the earth\\'s \\nresources are for the common good, where barriers fall and a special blessing \\nand care go to the poor. \\n\\n\\nMost people do not migrate because they want to. Immigrants are transnational \\nactors crossing from less developed to richer countries, and even if they are \\nnot aware of it, they show the interdependence of the world economy. A sense of \\nmoral responsibility for the countries of emigration can transform \\ninterdependence into solidarity. The impact, therefore, of our national \\ndecisions and policies goes beyond our borders and can affect all along the \\njourney of migrants from the start in their native countries to the point of \\nintegration into our society. To enable the weaker countries to develop and to \\nparticipate in making a contribution of their own to the common good becomes an \\neffective remedy to forced migrations. \\n\\n\\nThe temptation to confuse ethnic origin with religion could block the way of \\nsolidarity and allow the tyranny of lesser loyalties to stifle the bonding \\ntogether of natives and newcomers in the common task of developing another \\ncreative moment in the growth of the church and of the country. Different \\ncultural traditions and pastoral structures become as many valuable paths \\nleading to the acceptance of diversity within a basic Gospel unity. \\n\\n\\nThe positive lesson the immigrants\\' presence teaches comes from the heart of \\nthe Gospel, that we are one world family. The expression of this conviction is \\nin mutual knowledge, respect and love that enable us to find the fullness of \\nourselves in solidarity with others. We learn intercultural relations not just \\nto fight prejudice or to manage interethnic relations with less conflict, but \\nrather, as a way to live solidarity in our environment, as a new style of \\ncommunity needed now more than ever for the development of a pluralistic \\nsociety. \\n\\n\\nProjections indicate that immigration will continue due to economic disparity, \\na chronic lack of jobs, persistent political upheavals -- and hunger. \\n\\n\\nOur pastoral response has been moving on the twin track of justice and \\nevangelization articulated in policy advocacy, and the delivery of services \\nwithin our church structures. \\n\\n\\nTogether with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the archdiocese\\'s \\npolicy for undocumented persons includes support for expansion of legalization, \\na commitment to change the employer sanctions of the immigration law, safe \\nhaven for displaced persons and the development of poorer countries. We stand \\nfirm on the priority right of family reunion within a reasonable time. \\nImmigrants and refugees will continue to find a voice in the church where \\nacceptance and love have no borders. \\n\\n\\nDay after day, and with exceptional generosity, our archdiocese advises newly \\narrived immigrants and refugees, sponsors family reunification, provides legal \\nassistance and teaches English. At the regional and parish levels a variety of \\nservices are offered that witness our concern for the total person. \\n\\n\\nAllow me to stress the irreplaceable role of the parish where multicultural \\ncommunities of faith can flourish. A \"policy of inclusion\" should be part of \\nthe pastoral plan of each parish. \\n\\n\\nIn our parishes geographical distance has given way to the actual presence of \\npeople from every continent and culture. Newcomers must be welcomed as Christ \\nis welcomed. \\n\\n\\nMutual participation in the development of the parish future will succeed if \\nthere is a warm, loving and exciting attitude of acceptance; if time and space \\nare made available to people to meet one another at their leisure in \\nfriendship, if expressive, person-centered and vibrant liturgies teach as much \\nas they touch the heart. \\n\\n\\nIn moments of rethinking, retrenching and anxiety in the public debate on the \\npresence and meaning of newcomers and their cultures, we are reminded that \\n\"hospitality\" is the most concrete example of our solidarity with the world \\nfamily. \\n\\n\\nThe Scriptures state, \"continue to love each other like brothers and sisters, \\nand remember always to welcome strangers, for by doing this, some people have \\nentertained angels without knowing it.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\nLanguage:  English \\nArticle Type:CSO \\n\\n [Commentary by Egon T. Lansky, a journalist and political \\nanalyst who formerly served as Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry \\nspokesman and ambassador to the Council of Europe: \"After the \\nTragedy: A Look at Year One in the Two Republics\"] \\n  [Text] Despite being one of the staunchest defenders of \\nCzechoslovakia until the very last minutes of its existence, I \\nmust admit that the majority of people in both successor states \\nseem to have adapted to the new situation amazingly quickly. \\n  Maybe that is always so with majorities. Life simply goes \\non, \\nand most people cannot afford to do anything but try to hang on \\nthe best they can or else face the real existential dangers that \\nseem to be lurking everywhere. \\n  Passivity in the face of political decisions handed down \\nfrom \\nabove, such as the unpopular split of the Czechoslovak \\nfederation, is, after all, what people in post-Communist \\nsocieties have been used to for half a century, or even more. \\n  People might even be suffering from a sort of social amnesia \\nin reaction to the political shock treatment imposed by \\npolitical leaders in both republics, and especially in Slovakia, \\nwhere the negative consequences of the partition are much more \\nobvious. \\n  One year may be too soon to draw any final conclusions. \\nStill, it is a natural milestone for initial observations and \\nassessments of the \"state of the states.\" If there were a final \\ntally sheet of the direct expenses for each republic incurred as \\na result of the split, it would be much easier. But since I \\nsuspect we may never see that--when it comes to reliable \\nstatistics, we are far from having become real Western \\ndemocracies--empirical facts will have to do. \\n  As might have been expected, Slovakia seems to be the \\noutright loser. It could have been even worse, though. Both \\ninflation and employment are in double digits in Slovakia, but \\nnot any higher than in Poland or Hungary. \\n  The Czech government, of course, prides itself on having \\nkept \\nthe economy fully under control, even though, for all the \\nofficial optimism, there are several clouds on the horizon. Most \\nremarkably, Mr. Klaus and his team of economic ministers, while \\npreaching an extremely conservative message, have been carrying \\nout quite socialist economic policies. \\n  They have maintained strict control over incomes (except for \\nsalaries of the political establishment, which went up 24 \\npercent before Christmas); controlled the prices of energy, \\nhousing and, occasionally, food and transportation; and \\npostponed bankruptcies that could threaten anywhere from 15 to \\n30 percent of all industries. These practices have served to \\npush some problems into the future. And as long as this remains \\npossible, the Czech government will sit comfortably. \\n  No such luck for Mr. Meciar, who, on the contrary, seems to \\nbe the lone giant in Slovak politics after alienating even a \\ngood deal of his own party, the Movement for a Democratic \\nSlovakia. That Meciar still runs the government can be explained \\nby the fact that there is still no agreement either among the \\nopposition parties or between the growing number of rebels \\nwithin the two coalition parties. In Slovakia, there seems to be \\nno political power interested in governing after Meciar; while \\nin the Czech Republic, where the opposition appears to be even \\nweaker, there is a government that is definitely not lacking in \\nself-confidence. \\n  For small, new states in the middle of the old continent, \\none \\nof the most important interests must necessarily be \\ninternational politics. Even more so now that the shining \\nexample of Czechoslovakia, once the standard-bearer of countries \\nmaking a stable transition from communism to democracy, is no \\nmore. The new states will have to persuade the world of their \\nqualities, redefine their geopolitical orientations, and try to \\nrealize their national interests under new and as yet unproven \\ncircumstances. \\n  In this sense, it seems to me, both republics are in a \\nsignificantly more disadvantageous situation than they were \\nunder the umbrella of the federation--especially Slovakia, which \\nmore than any of the countries of the Visegrad group became part \\nof the true Eastern Europe. Its only borders with a true Western \\ndemocracy are those few miles along the Danube with Austria near \\nBratislava. \\n  Slovakia\\'s drift toward clearly unstable regions such as the \\nCommonwealth of Independent States and the Balkans is \\nstrengthened by tensions bubbling in the sough of Slovakia, \\nwhere the large Hungarian minority is becoming increasingly \\nalienated by growing Slovak nationalism. Slovakia\\'s search for \\nallies in Russia and Romania--something not only Mr. Meciar has \\nbeen taking seriously of late--indicates as well as anything \\nelse the negative change in geopolitical realities. \\n  Even the Czech Republic has found itself in a world more \\ncomplicated than ever before. True, ridding itself of Slovakia \\nwas some soft form of \"ethnic cleaning\"--for the first time in \\nmore than 350 years there is an independent Czech state as \\nhomogenous as the Czech nation.

He won electoral\\nsupport in the Czech lands because he promised to continue, and even\\naccelerate, the pace of privatisation and other reforms. These are designed\\nboth to prevent a return to the authoritarian past and to fulfil the\\ncriteria for full European Community membership by the turn of the century.\\nHis view that continuation of a common state on lines demanded by Mr\\nVladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, would both jeopardise economic reform\\nand risk pulling Czechoslovakia back towards its recently shed authoritarian\\npast is widely shared in the Czech lands.\\nBut the outcome of the negotiations also furnished the latest proof that the\\nricher and more numerous Czechs do indeed call the shots in the common\\nstate, as Slovaks have complained for decades. It is not easy to play second\\nfiddle without hope of advancement, and many Slovaks feel that 1,000 years\\nin somebody else's shadow is enough. It is also true that they have suffered\\nmore than the Czechs from economic policies made largely in Prague. Their\\nheavy industry was more vulnerable to the collapse of the Soviet market,\\nmore difficult to privatise and less able to adapt to western markets.\\nOnce independent, the Slovaks will be able to work out their own policies,\\nand make their own mistakes. This may be psychologically a good thing, if it\\nhelps them to work out long felt resentments. But they are likely to find\\nthat their freedom of manoeuvre is savagely limited.\\nIndependent Slovakia aspires to eventual EC membership, but to qualify, it\\nwill have to fulfil onerous entry requirements. That means an open and\\ncompetitive economy and respect for the rights of minorities. The irony is\\nthat this will require following similar policies to those demanded for\\ncontinuing the federal state.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\nBFN \\n\\n  [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef \\nMoravcik considers the division of Czechoslovakia only \\ntemporary, because it is probable, in his opinion, that both new \\nrepublics will become members of the European Union before the \\nend of the century, and will resume very close contact. \\n  The Premier told journalists today that apart from the \\nSlovak \\nNational Party (SNP), no political organization in the last \\nfederal elections had as part of its platform the division of \\nthe country, and more than half the citizens of Slovakia were \\nagainst it. \\n  The former Czechoslovakia, however, was based on \"Communist \\nfederalism,\" and relations between the two peoples did not \\ndevelop on a healthy basis, in the opinion of the Slovak \\nPremier. He said this was why the Slovak side tried in its \\nmutual relations to use the model of the European Union, which \\n\"did not gain acceptance, but which certainly well, and on an \\nhistorical scale.\" \\n  The division, according to Moravcik, was a compromise aimed \\nat resolving the dilemma of how to break out of a permanent \\nsituation of crisis, which was sinking ever deeper into \\ndiscussions about the optimal form of shared existence. \"We were \\nunable to decide on any other variant,\" Moravcik said. For \\nSlovakia, in his view, the acceptability of the split lay \\nprecisely in the fact that \"from the standpoint of the future, \\nnothing really would change.\" \\n  \"I was the first member of the federal government to foresee \\nthat Czechoslovakia would cease to exist at the end of 1992,\" \\nMoravcik emphasized, and added that he had himself voted for the \\nbreakup of the state. Making no attempt to deny the importance \\nof the \"national identity\" of the Slovaks, he said that from the \\nposition of his former post he had often discussed the \\npreservation of the Czechoslovak state with international \\ninstitutions, but with the condition that the Czech and Slovak \\nRepublics participate in European structures on an independent \\nbasis. \\n  \"National identity is a value which it is necessary to watch \\nover, integration is something else,\" he said. The fact that \\n\"both republics will belong to the greater European society is \\nnot at odds with the principle of national identity. It is the \\nresolution of relations between peoples in a European manner,\" \\nMoravcik stated. \\n  \"We had to explain to the world why Czechoslovakia is \\nsplitting up,\" he said. He considers the fact that it succeeded \\na very important factor in the present acceptance of both \\nrepublics, but especially of Slovakia. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

He\\nunderlined that Slovakia's economic prosperity and the maintenance of\\npolitical pluralism was also a political concern for the Czech Republic.\\nMr Meciar acknowledged, in a speech which implicitly recognised the fears\\nand reservations that many Slovaks harbour about the ending of the link with\\nthe more prosperous Czech Republic, that difficulties lay ahead for the\\nsmaller of the two new states. He assured Slovaks that links with the Czech\\nRepublic would continue to be close and that Slovakia 'needed neither\\ncustoms officers nor border crossings and other restrictions'.\\nBoth leaders underlined the difficulty of predicting the exact course of\\ntheir future relationship. Mr Meciar pledged to honour all obligations\\nassumed during the six months the two states moved apart and to co-operate\\nat the highest possible level.\\nHe and other leading Slovaks attended independence celebrations in\\nBratislava's central square, which began with the hoisting of the new flag\\nand the singing of the national anthem.

She said it was a special moment for all Slovaks, as\\npeople queued to smother her with kisses. Then, to the strains of The Blue\\nDanube, the singing and dancing continued into the night.\\nIn his speech the Slovak leader stressed the importance of relations with\\nAustria, and underlined Slovakia's 'permanent and sincere interest in good\\nrelations' with Hungary.

There was the familiar tale of the ignored junior partner making\\nthe kind of fuss that sells newspapers. The Slovaks for years have\\ncomplained about their richer Czech brethren and last weekend voted for\\nseparation, at least.\\nHeadlines trumpeted the imminent end of the Czechoslovak state, but crises\\nin that country often mean a good deal less than meets the eye. It was,\\nafter all, a 'massacre' in which nobody got killed that sparked off the\\n'velvet revolution' in which nobody got killed that led to the restoration\\nof democracy and the present difficulties.\\nSlovak editorials after the electoral triumph of the separatists did\\nnotcelebrate the demise of the federal state. Narodna Obroda had the\\nheadline: 'Keep to the constitution.' This stirring call to arms was\\nfollowed by a typical outburst of frenzied nationalism: 'In the interests of\\nSlovakia, it would be useful if the policy of the (victorious) HZDS party\\nwere based on a positive position. Ability to understand the political\\nimplications should be the main criterion for party leader Meciar when it\\ncomes to the settlement of the key question of relations between Czechs and\\nSlovaks.'\\nAttention to boring minutiae is a key characteristic of Czechoslovakia. When\\nthe communists were in control, there was an enormously popular radio show\\nwhere listeners answered abstruse questions relating to the law in spite of\\nits irrelevance under that political system.\\nMy view that the state will hold together, because the negotiations on how\\nto split it up will last forever, is not shared widely. But, in this part of\\nthe world, history hangs like a storm cloud over everything.\\nOutside Germany, nobody reported the traditional Whit Monday event there:\\nthe Day of the Expellees. Every year, the victims and their descendants\\ngather to mourn the day of expulsion from the Czech Sudetenland in 1945. The\\nSudeten Germans had welcomed Hitler's incorporation of the territory into\\nthe Reich in 1938 which is why, even in Germany, their plight evokes little\\nsympathy.\\nGermany and Czechoslovakia have signed a treaty designed to heal the wounds\\nof the past and maintain the status quo, which is the last thing the\\nexpellees want. At their rally, the premier of Bavaria, Max Streibl, said\\nhis Land would not support the treaty which accepts the expulsion as legal.\\nIt was, in fact, fairly horrible as Czech feelings were running high at the\\ntime. Streibl was accompanied by the federal finance minister, Theo Waigel.\\nThe expellees believe they deserve compensation, even the return of their\\nold homes.\\nThe tone of this year's rally was not enhanced by attempts to improve\\nrelations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Fifty participants left the\\nhall when one speaker said that not only the expulsion, but also the horrors\\nof the Nazis, had to be recalled.\\nThe Suddeutsche Zeitung, of Munich, said: 'The CSU politicians Streibl and\\nWaigel have rendered a disservice in their dismissive statements about the\\ntreaty text which they regard as incomplete. They attack the government for\\nhaving made a mess of it, and accuse Prague of refusing to make a full\\nreassessment of the past. In the same breath, Streibl said he wanted good\\nrelations with Czechoslovakia. But how can anybody trust such a statement\\nwhen relations are damaged by such Whitsun speeches?'\\nNeue Zeit, of Berlin, remarked that it was lucky Streibl had not spoken\\nbefore the Czechoslovak elections when he would have given the\\n'left-nationalists a few more votes.' That would be true in the Czech lands;\\nno German harbours resentment of the Slovaks, and vice versa, which could be\\nimportant one day. All this shows that no matter where it arises in Europe,\\nany problem is automatically a German problem.\\nBut all is quiet on the western front.

At the same time, he \\npraised the accommodating approach of Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus \\nas one enabling solutions to be found rapidly. \\n  After the split, Slovakia he said inherited high \\nunemployment \\nand a large foreign debt, with the economic performance down \\nover 30 per cent on 1992, and went on to deny his government\\'s \\nresponsibility for the facts. \\n  \"We have solved 95 per cent of the federal property \\ndivision, \\nbut you can criticize me for what\\'s left,\" he said. \\n  The government had to adopt immediate changes in the tax \\nsystem and budgeting, pass many new laws and prepare currency \\nseparation, Meciar said. \\n  \"The cabinet\\'s work schedule was punishing,\" he said in \\nrecognition of the cabinet members\\' efforts. Reflecting on the \\nallegations that he exerted too much control, he said he had \\nnever had real power, but only what he called an infinite \\nresponsibility for the running of institutions which were only \\nset up after Slovakia was founded. He said he gradually handed \\nthe responsibility over to them. \\n  The birth of Slovakia took place amid favorable \\ninternational \\nbut poor economic conditions, he said, defining the latter as \\nthe recession, loss of eastern markets and total lack of funds. \\nHe stressed that arms manufacturing has been willfully \\nsuspended and pointed out that it was being revived in the Czech \\nRepublic. \\n  After the split, Slovakia managed to avoid all of the \\nenvisaged complications. It created its own currency in a \\nfortnight, opened up foreign loan negotiations and has all but \\nimplemented the banking system. The rules of order, discipline \\nand the law has taken root, he said, adding that foreign \\ninvestors are showing signs of growing interest in the country \\nand that transformation of agriculture is under way. \"Can you \\ntell us who else has achieved that?\" Meciar asked, adding, \"We \\ndid.\" \\n  He also recalled government attempts at tapping Far Eastern \\nmarkets. Describing the attempts as an unfinished process, he \\nwarned against their dismissal. \\n  He pointed out that parliamentary political strife might \\nresult in slower transformation, delayed loans and pressure for \\nmore restrictive social measures. \\n  \"I feel the need to inform you about all this. You cannot \\ndestroy the continuity. There is a risk that in the second half \\nof the year the social agreement may come at an end in \\nSlovakia,\" Meciar warned. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

The two men met yesterday for crucial talks\\nwhich could decide whether their country splits apart.\\nMr Klaus, whose rightwing Civic Democratic party won most votes in the Czech\\nrepublic in last weekend's election, wants to retain a strong Czechoslovak\\nfederation and push through radical economic reforms. Mr Meciar, election\\nvictor in Slovakia, is keen to loosen ties with Prague and slow down\\nreforms. Yesterday, the two met half-way between Prague and the Slovak\\ncapital Bratislava. Talks continue today.\\nAs leaders of the two strongest parties, Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar must\\nestablish a working relationship if Czechoslovakia's two deeply-divided\\nparts are to remain together. The talks between the two will centre on the\\nform of the future federal government and the division of power between\\nCzechs and Slovaks within it.\\nMr Klaus has said he will reduce the federal government to a few key\\nministries - such as finance, economics, foreign affairs and defence - but\\nthis may lead to clashes with Slovaks, who want their republic freed from\\nfederal control.\\nMr Klaus has said that fiscal and economic policy must remain unified, but\\nSlovak nationalists want two central banks and full control of the\\nprivatisation programme in their republic.\\nAfter his election triumph, Mr Meciar said he would oppose President Vaclav\\nHavel when members of parliament vote in a presidential election next month.\\nHe said Mr Havel's chances of re-election were now minimal.\\nPresident Havel, whose immense personal authority makes him the main\\nunifying force in Czechoslovakia, will pull out of the election if the\\ncountry heads for a split and political and economic reforms are\\njeopardised.\\nMr Meciar held talks earlier yesterday with the leaders of the two next\\nstrongest Slovak parties in an attempt to form a regional government\\ncoalition. Mr Meciar favours two strong republics - the Czech lands and\\nSlovakia - which would conclude a treaty and only then agree to concede some\\npowers to a central federal government.\\nThis attitude is unacceptable to many Czech politicians who claim it would\\neffectively break up Czechoslovakia, born 74 years ago from the ashes of the\\nAustro-Hungarian Empire.\\nEconomic stakes, Page 2\\nEditorial Comment, Page 18\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

They\\nhave been saddled with the task of dividing up, as fairly as possible, not\\njust the country's armed forces and weapons but also its archives, including\\nimportant records from the second world war and the years of communist rule.\\nWorse, they have to find a solution before the country divides into the\\nrepublics of the Czech Lands and Slovakia on January 1 1993.\\nApart from cutting everything in three and handing two pieces to the Czechs\\nand one to the Slovaks, to correspond to the population ratio, they simply\\ndo not know how to begin dividing such historical material.\\nAs an example of the problem that breaking up can bring, the issue of the\\narchives is not entirely trifling. Slovakia's defence minister, Mr Jozef\\nTuchyna, has said that if there is no full agreement on defence between the\\ntwo republics before January 1, Slovakia may not accept any others.\\nDefence, agriculture and the division of federal property are the three\\ncrucial areas on which no consensus has yet been reached. The federal\\nproperty issue is proving particularly difficult and is unlikely to be\\nresolved by January 1. The main problem is that the federal parliament has\\nbeen unable to muster the necessary three-fifths majority to pass a bill\\nauthorising the division.\\nBoth the Czech and Slovak national councils have threatened to pass a\\nresolution forcing the parliament to act. The federal cabinet, meanwhile,\\nhas agreed to set up a special commission of senior officials from both\\nsides, headed by the federal prime minister, Mr Jan Strasky, to get things\\nmoving.\\nProperty will essentially be divided territorially and in proportion to\\npopulation, with special measures to compensate either republic in instances\\nwhere most of the property of a federal institution is located in the other.\\nSlovakia is expected to be the bigger beneficiary. Not only are most\\ngovernment buildings, for example, in Prague, the Czech capital, but the\\nCzechs also have most of the federal defence installations, though the\\narmaments industry is in Slovakia.\\nDespite these difficulties, however, progress has been made in other areas.\\nTo date, 22 agreements governing future relations between the Czech republic\\nand Slovakia have been signed by the republics' prime ministers, Mr Vaclav\\nKlaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar. The most important is a customs union due to\\ncome into force on January 1, which provides for abolition of all trade\\nrestrictions between the two republics, a single customs territory, and\\ncommon tariffs on trade with third countries.\\nBoth sides have also agreed to continue with a single currency - the koruna\\n -for up to six months after the split.\\nOther agreements include a pact on friendly relations; the harmonisation of\\nsocial security and health benefits; environmental protection; double\\ntaxation agreements; the protection of each republic's investments in the\\nother; and the maintenance of transport and telecommunications links.\\nThese achievements reflect areas with a broad element of consensus. The real\\nhaggling is over those areas where there is no common approach. Western\\ndiplomats praise the 'businesslike' manner adopted by both sides.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nMarch 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIT\\'S SHOWTIME FOR OSCAR; \\n\\n\\nAND THE ENVELOPES, PLEASE. . . \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right, friends. Too late for office pools but just in time for Academy \\nAwards parties, here are the Benson Oscar predictions, which come with the \\nheadstrong fearlessness of someone who has yet to win an office pool herself. \\n\\n\\nAs usual, I\\'ll list the way I think academy members will vote first and if I \\ndisagree, my own immodest favorite. Reasons are given as much as practicable. \\nLet\\'s tackle the acting categories first. \\n\\n\\nBest actor: Dustin Hoffman, because there seems to be a readable groundswell \\nfor him this year. My own choice would be Tom Hanks, who probably will suffer \\nbecause academy members think it\\'s too early in his career. Nonsense. The \\nnomination was certainly for two movies, not simply one and when you consider \\n\"Punchline\" as well as \"Big\" in the same year, we seem to be dealing with a \\nhuge and many-faceted talent. \\n\\n\\nBest actress: Jodie Foster, from a hunch based on the affection I\\'ve seen her \\ngenerate in appearances at various awards groups. She\\'s regarded as a real \\nHollywood product, as a veteran and even, as one friend suggested, as the \\nprodigal daughter come home again. And it is a phenomenal performance. My own \\nchoice, in a far less-seen and deliberately astringent film, is Meryl Streep in \\n\"A Cry in the Dark,\" who now seems to be able to throw away her formidable \\ntechnique and come up with the pure essence of a character. \\n\\n\\nSupporting actor: Martin Landau in \"Tucker: A Man and His Dream,\" because it\\'s \\na nice, safe, sentimental performance by a warmly regarded veteran. I shall \\nnever give up on Alec Guinness\\' performance in \"Little Dorrit\" myself, since it \\nseems the distillation of a life\\'s experience, on stage and off. \\n\\n\\nSupporting actress: I think this is where the vote for Sigourney Weaver will go \\nbecause I don\\'t think she\\'ll win in the best actress category. I guess, of the \\nchoices available, I\\'d go with Frances McDormand\\'s delicate shadings in the \\nindelicate \"Mississippi Burning,\" although I wish enough of the academy \\nnominators had seen Miriam Margolyes\\' Flora Finching in \"Little Dorrit.\" Ah \\nwell. \\n\\n\\nBest picture: \"Rain Man\" is all we hear, so it seems a safe-enough bet. For me: \\n\"The Accidental Tourist,\" whose humanity was a little less on display and thus \\na little more appealing, personally. And what a rainbow of performances it hid \\nbehind its quiet exterior. \\n\\n\\nDirector: Barry Levinson, for the reasons cited above. Also for the reasons \\ncited immediately above, it pains me to make a personal choice from what seems \\na foreshortened field. I want \"The Accidental Tourist\\'s\" Lawrence Kasdan to \\nwin, but he was not nominated. Deprived of that choice, I\\'ll say Charles \\nCrichton because comic charm is far too rarely encouraged. \\n\\n\\nArt direction: \"Dangerous Liaisons\" feels like the solid, showy pick that the \\nacademy might make. My heart, in this case, belongs to the less staid and \\nclassic but equally difficult \"Tucker.\" \\n\\n\\nCinematography: Peter Biziou\\'s work in \"Mississippi Burning\" seems to be the \\nsort that academy members best remember. My own choice would be Sven Nyquist\\'s \\nmultifaceted contributions to \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\" \\n\\n\\nCostume design: The extremely showy costumes of \"Dangerous Liaisons,\" where you \\ncould practically picnic on those panniers and pluck every one of those \\ndiabolical roses, would seem to be aimed straight at academy members\\' hearts. \\nFor me: the exquisite restraint and beauty of \"A Handful of Dust.\" \\n\\n\\nDocumentary features: Nice to know that the handful who voted in this category \\nactually saw the films (they had to, or they would not have been given a final \\nballot). And since that is the case, I would think that Marcel Ophuls\\' \"Hotel \\nTerminus: the Life and Times of Klaus Barbie\" would have made its singular \\nimpression on this thoughtful body. No quibble from me on that. \\n\\n\\nDocumentary shorts: \"You Don\\'t Have to Die,\" adapted from a young cancer \\npatient\\'s book addressed to children his own age would seem to be the winner \\nhere. The dark horse here would be \"The Children\\'s Storefront.\" I haven\\'t seen \\nthe entire category; this hunch comes from (relatively) trustworthy friends who \\nhave. \\n\\n\\nFilm editing: You hear an awful lot of talk about \"Die Hard\" in this category, \\nwhich may be the way the academy will swing. I think my own choice would be \\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" \\n\\n\\nForeign language film: For a long while it seemed as though \"Pelle the \\nConqueror\" had a lock on this award. Now, one hears rumbles that supporters of \\n\"Pelle\" and \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\" will cancel each other \\nout and \"The Music Teacher\" will sneak through. Meanwhile, I\\'ll be rooting for \\n\"Salaam Bombay!\" \\n\\n\\nMakeup: Let\\'s be lighthearted and go with a double vote for \"Beetlejuice\" here, \\njust as though Rick Baker (\"Coming to America\") didn\\'t seem to be attached to \\nthis award like Velcro. \\n\\n\\nOriginal score: John Williams is an even harder man to beat than Rick Baker, so \\nthis may be one place where \"Accidental Tourist\" wins. Two of the finest \\nscores, Mark Isham\\'s magical work on \"The Moderns\" and Peter Gabriel\\'s \\nsuperior, atmospheric music for \"The Last Temptation of Christ,\" didn\\'t even \\nmake the cut, so I feel vastly disinterested. If pushed, I guess I\\'d go with \\n\"Tourist\" too. \\n\\n\\nOriginal song: Could the academy resist \"Calling You\" from \"Bagdad Cafe\"? No! \\nAnd I certainly couldn\\'t either. \\n\\n\\nShort film, animation: \"The Cat Came Back,\" which is as lively as its old \\nchildren\\'s song, and even more fun. A double vote here. \\n\\n\\nShort film, live action: Thin pickings this year.: \"The Appointments of Dennis \\nJennings\" might well be the academy pick, again on the hint of those who saw \\nall three. \\n\\n\\nSound: Certainly, this is one of the places where the many virtues of \"Who \\nFramed Roger Rabbit?\" is recognized, no? Yes. A double yes. \\n\\n\\nSound effects editing: And again, I would imagine that \"Who Framed Roger \\nRabbit\" would make its paw print here too. For me, as well. \\n\\n\\nVisual effects: This gets down to imagination versus hard-core realism, but I \\nthink that \"Roger Rabbit\" may squeak by over \"Die Hard.\" That would be my own \\nvote too. \\n\\n\\nOriginal screenplay: I think the voters will let poor old \"Bull Durham\" have \\nits one chance in the sun here. But because I think its dialogue is more like \\ngreat reading than great talking, my own vote slides over to \"Big.\" \\n\\n\\nScreenplay adaptation: Personally, this is the hardest one to psyche out. The \\nWriters Guild went for \"Dangerous Liaisons,\" which makes me think that the \\nacademy might too. It\\'s hardly a secret that I am a great admirer of the work \\nthat Christine Edzard did in adapting \"Little Dorrit\" so, much as I love \"The \\nAccidental Tourist,\" I would defect here to writer-director Edzard. \\n\\n\\nSo there you have it, bets for what has certainly seemed like one of the most \\nlethargic and least interesting Oscar races in years. Just think of the furor \\nthat might have been stirred up if a few of the notable non-nominees had been \\nin the running: combinations of actors or behind-the-camera artists from \"The \\nModerns,\" \"Dead Ringers,\" \"Clean and Sober,\" \"Clara\\'s Heart,\" \"Patty Hearst,\" \\n\"Eight Men Out,\" \"Dominick and Eugene,\" \"The Thin Blue Line,\" \"Crossing \\nDelancey,\" \"Hairspray,\" \"Punchline,\" \"Stormy Monday,\" \"Red Sorghum,\" \"A World \\nApart,\" or even the great, ineligible \"Wings of Desire.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

The movie was based on a \\nbest-selling novel by Anne Tyler. \\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, Warner Brothers\\' \"Bird\" won an Oscar for sound, the only category in \\nwhich the Clint Eastwood-directed film about jazz great Charlie Parker was \\nnominated. \\n\\n\\nDisney\\'s \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" also won an early evening award for sound \\nediting. \"Roger Rabbit,\" a huge box office hit, did not receive nominations in \\nany major category. \\n\\n\\nThe evening\\'s heavy favorite remained MGM/UA\\'s \"Rain Man.\" The film, about the \\nadventures of an autistic savant and his car-salesman brother, led the pack \\nwith eight nominations, including best-picture and a best-actor nomination for \\nscreen veteran Dustin Hoffman. \\n\\n\\nThe 51-year-old Los Angeles-born actor has been nominated as best actor six \\ntimes and won an Oscar in 1980 for his performance in \"Kramer vs. Kramer.\" \\n\\n\\nOther nominees for best actor included Gene Hackman for \"Mississippi Burning,\" \\nTom Hanks for \"Big,\" Max von Sydow for \"Pelle the Conqueror\" and Edward James \\nOlmos for \"Stand and Deliver.\" \\n\\n\\nBy the time the stars began to arrive, the crowd out front waiting to greet \\nthem was estimated at 2,000. \\n\\n\\nAlan Carr, the ABC telecast\\'s producer, opened the show with a tribute to the \\nCocoanut Grove, which had been an early Oscar venue. \\n\\n\\nIn one signal change, celebrity presenters were instructed to say, \"And the \\nOscar goes to . . . ,\" rather than the customary \"And the winner is. . . .\" The \\nnew formula was supposed to lesson the sense of competition among the stars. \\n\\n\\nThe show was being aired live throughout the world, including in the Soviet \\nUnion for the first time. \\n\\n\\nA triumph by \"Rain Man\" would be particularly sweet for Lee Rich, Tony \\nThomopoulos and other deposed executives of MGM/UA Communications Co., who left \\nthe studio last year amid differences with Kirk Kerkorian, the studio\\'s \\nprincipal owner. \\n\\n\\nThe film itself had a tumultuous production history. It evolved from a much \\nrewritten screenplay originally conceived by Barry Morrow, ricocheted from one \\ndirector to another before landing with Barry Levinson, and grew from a small, \\narty film into a big-budget star vehicle backed by the powerful Creative \\nArtists Agency, which represents its co-stars Hoffman and Tom Cruise. \\n\\n\\nLast year, \"The Last Emperor,\" distributed by Columbia Pictures, swept nine \\nOscars, including the best picture award. This year Columbia, under a new \\nstudio administration, had no nominations. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBest Picture Nominees \\n\\n\\nOther best picture nominees this year included 20th Century Fox\\'s \"Working \\nGirl,\" Warner Bros.\\' \"The Accidental Tourist\" and \"Dangerous Liaisons,\" and \\nOrion\\'s \"Mississippi Burning.\" \\n\\n\\n\"Dangerous Liaisons,\" about the immoral doings of 18th-Century French \\naristocrats, and \"Mississippi Burning,\" a reality-based film about the murder \\nof three civil rights workers in the 1960s, were close behind \"Rain Man\" with \\nseven nominations each. \\n\\n\\nAny recognition for \"Mississippi Burning\" could trigger controversy, since the \\nfilm, while well received, has been excoriated by Coretta Scott King, widow of \\nthe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and various black groups for downplaying the \\nrole of blacks in the \\'60s civil rights struggle. \\n\\n\\nThe bellwether pre-Oscar awards pointed in several directions this year. While \\nthe Directors Guild of America honored director Barry Levinson for his work on \\n\"Rain Man,\" the Writers Guild of America bypassed the film to honor \\nscreenwriter Ron Shelton for Orion\\'s \"Bull Durham,\" a baseball picture that \\nreceived no other nominations. \\n\\n\\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., meanwhile, gave its Golden Globe Award for \\nbest movie to \"Rain Man,\" but presented a best-director award to Eastwood for \\n\"Bird.\" \\n\\n\\nThe best actress category did not appear to be dominated by any heavy favorite \\nin the pre-Oscar handicapping. \\n\\n\\nNominees included Glenn Close for \"Dangerous Liaisons;\" Jodie Foster for \"The \\nAccused;\" Melanie Griffith for \"Working Girl;\" Meryl Streep for \"A Cry in the \\nDark,\" and Sigourney Weaver for \"Gorillas in the Mist.\" \\n\\n\\nAll but Griffith had previous Oscar nominations, and Weaver enjoyed the rare \\ndistinction of a second nomination this year as best supporting actress in \\n\"Working Girl.\" \\n\\n\\nIf Neilsen ratings for the three hour-plus show have dipped over the years, \\nHollywood appears more enamored of its annual celebration than ever. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which sponsors \\nthe awards, a record 87 screen stars were expected to attend this year\\'s \\nblack-tie ceremony. \\n\\n\\nAmong the best-picture nominees, \"Rain Man\" was clearly the box office \\nfavorite, with more than $120 million in ticket sales so far. \"The Last \\nEmperor,\" last year\\'s winner, grossed only about $43 million at the U.S. box \\noffice. \\n\\n\\nAccording to Entertainment Data Inc., a box office consulting firm, Sigourney \\nWeaver and Tom Hanks are clearly the biggest grossing stars among this year\\'s \\nnominees. Films starring Weaver have grossed $401 million since 1982, while \\nfilms starring Hanks have taken in $415 million for the same period. \\n\\n\\nAs the show opened, Oscar officials scouted for guests carrying any of 40 \\ntickets that had been picked up by a man claiming to be a 20th Century Fox \\npublicity official. The academy said it would press charges if it could prove \\nthat any guest knowingly tried to use a stolen ticket. \\n\\n\\nIt could not immediately be learned if any guest had been stopped for carrying \\na stolen ticket. No arrests had been made in the theft of the tickets. \\n\\n\\nDespite tight control by the academy, scalped tickets sold from $500 for \\nbalcony seats to $2,000 for the best seats. \\n\\n\\nThis year the academy chose not to present its Irving Thalberg Award, an Oscar \\nthat is periodically given for sustained excellence in film making. \\n\\n\\nLast year, the award was given to Austrian-born writer and director Billy \\nWilder. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nMarch 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSOMETHING FOR EVERYONE . . . ALMOST; \\n\\n\\nACADEMY VOTERS SURVEY THE FIELD, AND SPREAD THE WEALTH \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, it did turn out to be \"Rain Man\\'s\" evening, but not until the last few \\nminutes, and if there was a message in Wednesday night\\'s Academy Awards \\nresults, it\\'s that parity has returned to Hollywood. \\n\\n\\nFor two-thirds of the show, the academy voters seemed determined to give an \\naward to every film nominated. As it was, 10 different movies split 17 awards, \\nthe most winners for one year in this decade. \\n\\n\\nThe major awards made the forecasters look smart and the academy predictable. \\n\"Rain Man\" did win the grand prize (and three other big ones) and \"Mississippi \\nBurning,\" with just one Oscar for cinematography, did get punished for its \\nhighly publicized historical muddling. \\n\\n\\nBut gone, for a refreshing change, was the slate voting that has turned many \\nrecent Academy Awards shows into one-note evenings that kept some deserving \\npeople out of the Oscar resale market. \\n\\n\\n\"Rain Man,\" its director Barry Levinson, Hoffman and the screenwriters (the two \\nof several who worked on it) may have fulfilled their roles as favorites, but \\nthere were no sure things elsewhere, and people looking for early patterns had \\nto throw away the form. \\n\\n\\nThe final score shows \"Rain Man\" with four Oscars and \"Dangerous Liaisons\" and \\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" with three each. But there were seven other films \\nwith one award each. \\n\\n\\nWhether the spread represents a change in voting habits, or an absence of a \\nfilm to rally around, it made for a great show and in some cases, the awards \\nhelped right some wrongs in the nominations process. \\n\\n\\nThat \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" won three of the six awards for which it was \\nnominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one 1988 \\nfilm sure to be regarded as a classic. \\n\\n\\nThe good news for observers of voter psychology were the awards given to films \\nthat were not box-office hits. The voters tend to favor those films that are \\nboth of substance and commercially successful (thus: \"Rain Man\"), and whether \\nthey even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned. \\n\\n\\nThis year, several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers \\nat the box office: Jodie Foster as best actress from \"The Accused,\" Geena Davis \\nas best supporting actress from \"The Accidental Tourist.\" \\n\\n\\nMore surprising were the awards given to \"Bird\" and \"The Milagro Beanfield \\nWar,\" films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store \\nlooking for alternatives. \\n\\n\\nBoth films were flawed, but the sound editing done for \"Bird,\" which seamlessly \\nblended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary \\nmusicians, was brilliant and deserved the award its four-man sound team won. \\n\\n\\nDavid Grusin\\'s Oscar for scoring \"The Milagro Beanfield War\" overcame even \\nbigger odds, winning over popular John Williams\\' score for \"The Accidental \\nTourist.\" \\n\\n\\nThe selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film \\nindustry had, and whether the spread is a quirk, one can hope it suggests a \\ntrend. \\n\\n\\nThe 1988 slate of films was, on total, a marked improvement over recent years. \\nThe industry is still adjusting to its changing -- its older and more demanding \\naudience -- and that means a wider variety of films.

Final \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'RAIN MAN\\' GIVEN 8 OSCAR NOMINATIONS; SIGOURNEY 2; \\n\\n\\nHOFFMAN WINS 6TH ACTING NOD \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMGM/UA\\'s \"Rain Man\" took a narrow lead in the 61st Oscar race today with eight \\nnominations, including Dustin Hoffman\\'s sixth best-actor nod for his portrayal \\nof a numbers-crunching autistic savant on a cross-country trek with his hustler \\nbrother, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced at a \\npre-dawn news conference at its Beverly Hills headquarters. \\n\\n\\nThe popular \"Rain Man\" -- which has grossed more than $100 million since its \\nDecember premiere -- also received nominations for best picture, directing, \\nscreenplay written directly for the screen, art direction, editing, original \\nmusic and cinematography. \\n\\n\\nSigourney Weaver became the fifth performer in Oscar history to receive two \\nacting nominations in one year. Weaver was nominated as best actress for \\nplaying murdered naturalist Dian Fossey in \"Gorillas in the Mist\" \\n(Universal/Warner) and as best supporting actress for playing a mean, \\nexploitative executive in \"Working Girl.\" The last actress to receive dual \\nnominations was Jessica Lange in 1982. \\n\\n\\nThe other top film nominees are best-picture candidates \"Dangerous Liaisons\" \\nfrom Warner Bros. and Orion\\'s \"Mississippi Burning,\" which received seven \\nnominations each, and 20th Century Fox\\'s best-picture nominee \"Working Girl\" \\nwith six nominations and Touchstone\\'s hugely successful \"Who Framed Roger \\nRabbit\" with six nominations in technical categories. \\n\\n\\nRounding out the five-film slate of best-picture nominees is Warner\\'s \"The \\nAccidental Tourist,\" which received a total of four nominations. \\n\\n\\nThe Oscar nominees were announced at an academy news conference that was held \\nat 5:30 a.m. in order to receive live coverage from the major networks\\' \\nearly-morning news programs. The Oscars will be presented March 29 at the \\nShrine Civic Auditorium. The ceremony will be broadcast on ABC. \\n\\n\\nIn a major surprise, Martin Scorsese got a best director nomination for \"The \\nLast Temptation of Christ\" (Universal), after the iconoclastic and \\ncontroversial film about Jesus Christ was passed over in earlier movie awards. \\nOther best director nominees are Charles Crichton for \"A Fish Called Wanda\" \\n(MGM/UA), Alan Parker for \"Mississippi Burning,\" Barry Levinson for \"Rain Man\" \\nand Mike Nichols for \"Working Girl.\" \\n\\n\\nBesides Weaver, the best actress nominees are Glenn Close, who received her \\nfifth Oscar nomination for her performance as a coldly manipulative seductress \\nin \"Dangerous Liaisons\"; Jodie Foster, who played a rape victim in Paramount\\'s \\n\"The Accused\"; Melanie Griffith, who played an ambitious secretary in \"Working \\nGirl,\" and Meryl Streep, who played a mother accused of child-murder in \\nWarner\\'s \"A Cry in the Dark.\" Streep, who has been nominated for eight Oscars \\nin her career, is the only previous best-actress winner in the group. \\n\\n\\nJoining one-time best-actor winner Hoffman among the nominees is another \\nprevious winner, Gene Hackman. He received the nod for his performance as an \\nFBI agent in \"Mississippi Burning.\" \\n\\n\\nThe rest of the best-actor pack are all first-time nominees: Tom Hanks, as a \\nboy trapped in a man\\'s body in Fox\\'s \"Big\"; Edward James Olmos, as Los Angeles \\nteacher Jaime Escalante in Warner\\'s \"Stand and Deliver,\" and Max von Sydow, as \\na Swedish farmhand in Miramax\\'s \"Pelle the Conqueror.\" \\n\\n\\nIn addition to Weaver, the best supporting actresses include first-time \\nnominees Joan Cusack for \"Working Girl,\" Geena Davis for \"Accidental Tourist,\" \\nFrances McDormand for \"Mississippi Burning\" and Michelle Pfeiffer for \\n\"Dangerous Liaisons.\" \\n\\n\\nBest supporting actor nominees are two-time Oscar-winner Alec Guinness for \\nCannon\\'s \"Little Dorrit\" and first-time nominees Kevin Kline for \"A Fish Called \\nWanda\"; Marin Landau for Paramount\\'s \"Tucker: The Man and his Dream\"; River \\nPhoenix for Warner\\'s \"Running on Empty,\" and Dean Stockwell for Orion\\'s \\n\"Married to the Mob.\" \\n\\n\\nNominees for best original screenplay were Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg for \\n\"Big,\" Ron Shelton, for Orion\\'s \"Bull Durham,\" John Cleese for \"A Fish Called \\nWanda,\" Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow for \"Rain Man,\" and Naomi Foner for \\n\"Running on Empty.\" \\n\\n\\nBest screenplay from another medium nominees were Frank Galati and Lawrence \\nKasdan for \"The Accidental Tourist,\" Christopher Hampton for \"Dangerous \\nLiaisons,\" Anna Hamilton Phelan for \"Gorillas in the Mist,\" Christine Edzard \\nfor \"Little Dorrit,\" and Jean-Claude Carriere and Philip Kaufman for \"The \\nUnbearable Lightness of Being.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFILM MAKERS URGE ACADEMY TO CHANGE SELECTION SYSTEM; \\n\\n\\nOSCARS: LETTER SEEKS A WRITE-IN VOTE TO REMEDY THE EXCLUSION OF \\'ROGER & \\nME,\\' TERMED \\'THIS YEAR\\'S MOST VISIBLE, BITING DOCUMENTARY.\\' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nControversy and the Academy Awards are inextricably linked. But in recent \\ntimes, the best documentary selections seem to have stirred up more than their \\nshare. \\n\\n\\nLast year, the uproar centered on the exclusion of \"The Thin Blue Line\" from \\nthe list of Oscar contenders. This year, the protest took the form of a letter \\nsent, two days ago, to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences \\nexpressing \"shock and outrage\" over the omission of \"Roger & Me\" -- Michael \\nMoore\\'s popular, if controversial, look at the impact of GM layoffs in Flint, \\nMich. The film has grossed more than $5 million since it was released Dec. 20. \\n\\n\\nSigned by 44 film makers including Haskell Wexler (\"Medium Cool\"), Robert Young \\n(\"Triumph of the Spirit\") and Mira Nair (\"Salaam Bombay\"), the letter called \\nfor a restructuring of the academy\\'s nominating committee as well for a \\nwrite-in vote to remedy the exclusion of what it termed \"this year\\'s most \\nvisible, biting documentary.\" \\n\\n\\nThe group calls for the academy to change its selection system so that the \\nnominations reflect \"the best, most diverse and innovative films in the field.\" \\n\\n\\nUnder the current system, most Oscar nominations are made by professional \\ngroups within the movie industry: the directors branch of the academy nominates \\ndirectors; cinematographers select cinematographers and so on. \\n\\n\\nBut, because there is no documentary branch, nominations in that category are \\ncurrently made by a committee composed of about four dozen writers, actors, \\neditors and some documentary film makers. The committee is also dominated by \\npersons who live in the Los Angeles area and, say the critics, is not \\nrepresentative of the nation-wide documentary film community. \\n\\n\\nThis year the committee screened 59 films. It took six hours a week over a \\ntwo-month period to see all the movies so few people with busy schedules are \\ndrawn to the task in the first place. \\n\\n\\n\"What you have here is a volunteer committee of good-hearted but fairly \\nout-of-touch senior citizens acting as a roadblock against the advancement of \\nthose films which don\\'t conform to its old-fashioned standards,\" says Chicago \\nSun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, whose syndicated column appearing this week \\noutlines some of the alleged inequities in the selection process. \\n\\n\\n\"Awards are everything to a documentary film,\" Ebert says. \"Without them, they \\ncan\\'t get distributed.\" \\n\\n\\nThe group of film makers who wrote to the academy want the same kind of \\ntreatment that other professionals in the industry receive. \\n\\n\\n\"Documentary nominations should be made by active documentary film makers -- a \\npanel of peers across the nation,\" says documentarian Pamela Yates, a friend of \\nMoore\\'s who drafted the letter. \"Hollywood is only the feature-film capital.\" \\n\\n\\nAccording to Bruce Davis, executive director of the academy, prospects for the \\ncreation of a documentary branch of the academy are dim. \\n\\n\\n\"There are three board members for each of the 12 branches of the academy -- \\nand enough examples of unwieldy boards around town to convince us that we\\'re \\nalready pushing the outer edges of the envelope. We\\'ve tried to revise the \\nsystem, however, limiting membership on the executive committee to a period of \\nnine years to insure some turnover and expanding the membership of the \\nscreening committee to dilute the impact of any individual.\" \\n\\n\\nOne individual in question is Mitchell Block, an influential member of the \\ndocumentary screening committee since 1979. Though Block was not directly \\nmentioned in the Yates letter, an accompanying press release alluded to the \\nfact that his firm, Direct Cinema -- a Los Angeles distribution company \\nspecializing in documentary films -- represents three of the five \\nfeature-length documentaries nominated this year, as well as one of the shorts. \\n\\n\\nThough Block declined to be interviewed for this article, a Direct Cinema \\ncompany spokesman acknowledged that, over the past 10 years, the company has \\nhandled about 20% of all documentary nominees and 35% of the winners. As \\nrequired by the academy, Block has submitted a conflict-of-interest statement \\neach year and has refrained from participating in discussions about any of his \\nprojects. \\n\\n\\n\"Mr. Block has never tried to lobby for his films,\" says Chuck Workman, an \\nOscar-winning documentary film maker (\"Precious Images\") who sits on the \\ncommittee. \"As far as I know, his behavior this year has been good across the \\nboard. The members are quite independent-minded and would be offended at the \\nsuggestion that he in any way affected their votes.\" \\n\\n\\nEven Haskell Wexler, one of the signers of the protest letter, is uncomfortable \\nwith the suggestion that the statistics are a sure sign of guilt. \"I don\\'t know \\nthe man, but Mr. Block may just be very good at his business . . . someone with \\ngood taste.\" \\n\\n\\n\"Every year, someone is upset because a film hasn\\'t been nominated,\" says an \\nexecutive at Block\\'s Direct Cinema. \"And every year, Mitchell -- and the \\nprocess -- become a convenient scapegoat. Having our company handle a film \\ndoesn\\'t increase the chance of it receiving an Oscar nomination because, from \\nthe moment a producer signs with us, Mitchell is forced to disqualify himself \\nfrom any involvement in the decision-making process. You\\'d think he\\'d be \\nexactly the kind of member the critics are looking for: a person involved in \\nthe field who takes the time to watch the movies . . . someone who\\'s under 60 \\nyears old. \" \\n\\n\\nThough there have been no substantiated allegations of wrongdoing, the \\npotential for conflict-of-interest precipitated an attempt to remove Block from \\nthe committee in 1986. No action was taken, however, after Block pointed out \\nthat it was a problem endemic to the academy as a whole. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s true, as Mr. Block points out, that there is conflict-of-interest in all \\ncategories,\" acknowledges the academy\\'s Bruce Davis. \"Actors can vote for \\nthemselves. Studios vote on their own releases. But in most areas the pool is \\nso vast that those things cancel themselves out. Documentaries are a relatively \\nsmall world. We\\'ve always been extremely sensitive to the \\'Caesar\\'s wife\\' \\nargument . . . that Caesar\\'s wife must be above suspicion. There\\'s no \\npossibility of a write-in vote . . . they\\'ve been banned since 1936. But the \\nletter will cause us to take a good look at the composition of the committee. \\nEven the appearance of impropriety will receive our conscientious attention. \\nWe\\'re very finicky about this type of thing.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nMarch 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCRITIC AT LARGE: THE OSCARS GO GLOBAL \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo things are true. One is that the Academy Award show, like a circus or a \\nDoo-Dah Parade, can only be compared with itself. It\\'s not like anything else. \\nAnother truth is that if you\\'ve seen one Academy Award show, you haven\\'t seen \\n\\'em all, despite the dread familiarity of the basic format. Each Oscar night \\nacquires a personality of its own, somewhere between chaos and a shiny, limited \\nperfection. \\n\\n\\nThis was the international year, not only in the satellite pickups from around \\nthe globe, but, very movingly, in the honoring of Akira Kurosawa, the \\n80-year-old Japanese filmmaker. \\n\\n\\nCo-presenting the special Academy Award with George Lucas, Steven Spielberg \\nsaid, \"Most of us think of him as the greatest living filmmaker . . . one of \\nthe few true visionaries of film.\" \\n\\n\\nThe elegant, erect old man with the gray hair, the dark glasses and the sly \\nsense of humor that even survived translation, drew a standing ovation. The \\nexpertly chosen clips from his films, from \"The Seven Samurai\" and \"Rashomon\" \\nto his spectacular transliteration of \"King Lear,\" \"Ran,\" made clear how well \\ndeserved the honor was. \\n\\n\\nYet there was another sense in which Kurosawa seemed to belong in the pantheon \\nof the great filmmakers who have had hell\\'s own time finding the money to make \\ntheir superb but not invariably profitable films. It is a select group that has \\nincluded D.W. Griffith, Luis Bunuel, Orson Welles, David Lean, Federico Fellini \\nand other creative giants without whom film history would be poorer. \\n\\n\\n\"Kurosawa can\\'t get a job in Japan,\" Spielberg remarked to a friend not long \\nago, in a mixture of indignation and astonishment. Indeed, George Lucas was \\ninstrumental in helping Kurosawa find financing for \"Ran\" and Spielberg himself \\nused his own powers of persuasion to get Warner Bros. to back Kurosawa\\'s latest \\nfilm, \"Dreams.\" \\n\\n\\nThe clips demonstrated what a remarkable maker of images Kurosawa is: the sweep \\nof his battle scenes, the intensity of the intimate moments, the humor and the \\nbiting despairs. You don\\'t wonder that \"Seven Samurai\" became the inspiration \\nfor \"The Magnificent Seven.\" The contests between evil and a badly overmatched \\ngood, which nevertheless triumphs in the end, is the stuff of Westerns as well \\nas Easterns, with a touch of irony that was late seeping into Westerns. \\n\\n\\nThe theme that has run through all his 27 films in 47 years (not that many, \\nattesting to his struggles), Kurosawa has said, is \"Why can\\'t people be happier \\ntogether?\" And in settings both ancient and modern, George Lucas noted, \\nKurosawa has presented his theme in stories and images of awesome and tragic \\nbeauty. \\n\\n\\nWhatever one\\'s feelings about the Academy Awards -- whether it is seen as a \\nminor if lively amusement or as a fascinating reflection of the state of a \\nstill-potent medium -- this year\\'s nominations and awards, and the show itself, \\nconfirm some trends that have been visible for several recent years. \\n\\n\\nOne is the voters\\' increasing picky discretion. The huge winner-take-all sweeps \\nseem quite unlikely to happen in future as they used to. The ever-larger number \\nof voters, now 4,900, admits of too much diversity of thought. The margins of \\ntriumph are likely to be as narrow as they were this time, although the best \\npicture will always have the supreme cachet, however many other Oscars support \\nit. \\n\\n\\nThe other trend is in fact the internationalism itself: the voters\\' eye for \\nwork from elsewhere, in whatever language: witness the nomination for a French \\nactress, an Irish film, an English film, and so on. It may well be true, \\nalthough not inevitably so, that the home product will have a home-field \\nadvantage (not least because it has been more widely seen). But the movies have \\nbeen growing more international for a long time -- pushed abroad in some \\nmeasure by the competitive pressure of television. Costs were lower abroad, for \\na while anyway, but what was also true was that as the domestic market shrank, \\nthe foreign market loomed ever more important (and still does). That put a \\npremium on international stars and exotic settings, which were also a contrast \\nto the domesticity of television. \\n\\n\\nWhat the Oscars argue, of course, is that the epicenter of movies is still \\nHollywood, gaudy and energetic, optimistic in its story-tellings, capable of \\nsudden sensitivity as well as muscular action. \\n\\n\\nWho won what begins to blur almost immediately, but the remembered excitement \\nremains. And among the specifics likely to stay in mind about the 1990 show are \\nthe quick and large standing ovation for Jessica Tandy, by all odds the night\\'s \\nmost popular winner, and the miracle of his Japanese family and friends, in \\nJapan, singing \"Happy Birthday\" along with an audience in Los Angeles, to a \\nmaster of film, standing, pleased and seemingly surprised, with two young \\nmasters of film who share his love of the not yet fully grasped possibilities \\nof the medium. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Instead, there was an almost audible shared sigh of relief that \\nthis year\\'s Oscar contenders were almost entirely made up of \"commercial\" and \\nnot \"arty\" films. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad to see that most of the films that were nominated are commercial \\nenough to play in all markets,\" said Bradford Bills, owner of Independent Film \\nServices of Kansas City, Mo., echoing the sentiments of many of his fellow \\nconventioneers. \\n\\n\\n\"Generally, you can\\'t take a picture like \\'Gandhi\\' or \\'The Last Emperor\\' and \\nexpect to throw it into a rural farming community or a suburb situation.\" \\n\\n\\nThat\\'s certainly not the case with \\'Rain Man,\\' which is playing in many of the \\nmovie houses run by these members of the National Assn. of Theater Owners \\n(NATO). \\n\\n\\n\"Everyone\\'s already been coming out to see \\'Rain Man\\' and now this is going to \\nbring even more people out,\" predicted Bob Bagby, an executive with the B and B \\nMovie Co. of South Ferry, Mo., who like other theater managers expect a \\nbox-office bonanza from Wednesday\\'s nominations. Generally, the ShoWest \\nattendees predicted that the Oscar announcements would mean a 25% \\nacross-the-board rise in business for the nominated films. And what\\'s \\nfortuitous for them is that most of these movies are playing in their theaters \\nright now. \\n\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter to us if the winner is \\'Rain Man\\' or \\'Working Girl\\' or \\n\\'Mississippi Burning,\\' \" Bagby explained. \"We\\'ll still be very happy because we \\nhave them on all our screens!\\' \\n\\n\\nAgain with box office in mind, a few conventioneers hoped \"Mississipp Burning\" \\nwould come away with the best picture Oscar if for no other reason than that -- \\nin the words of one theater owner -- \"it needs the business more than \"Rain \\nMan\" does.\\' \" \\n\\n\\nOne surprise for attendees was the failure of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" to \\ngarner a best picture, best director or best actor nod. Some agreed with the \\nacademy\\'s snub. \\n\\n\\n\"As far as the technical achievements of the film, it well merited anything \\nthat it got,\" explained Tina Carpenter, manager of UA Theaters in West Palm \\nBeach, Fla. \"But as far as being the best film, it wasn\\'t the best picture I\\'ve \\never seen.\" \\n\\n\\nTed Conley, head film buyer for Cinemark Corp. in Dallas, Tex., which owns 400 \\nscreens nationally, also believed that \"technically, it\\'s great. But I just \\ndon\\'t think it\\'s that artistic a film acting-wise or in any other vein.\" \\n\\n\\nOthers likened the Academy\\'s treatment of \"Roger Rabbit\" to what happened to \\n\"E.T.,\" another huge hit at the box office. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s typical of the academy,\" noted Gayle Smith, owner of the Movie Park \\nDrive-in in Siloam Springs, Ariz. \"Usually, the movies which the public likes \\nbest aren\\'t best picture winners. The people who do the nominations are not in \\ntouch with the public. Maybe it\\'s because they\\'re all rich.\" \\n\\n\\nSome names that were missing from the best actor and best actress categories \\ncaused hardly an eyebrow to raise here. No one seemed to like Bette Midler in \\n\"Beaches\" while William Hurt and Kathleen Turner failed to impress in \\n\"Accidental Tourist.\" \\n\\n\\n\"Thank God, Hurt didn\\'t make it,\" exclaimed Bradford Bills, owner of \\nIndependent Film Services of Kansas City, Mo. \"It was another typical \\nperformance from him and I\\'m so sick of seeing him nominated.\" \\n\\n\\nThere was general agreement that Dustin Hoffman was a shoo-in for best actor, \\nand theater owners credited his performance as the main reason for the film\\'s \\nsuccess with audiences. \\n\\n\\n\"And it redeemed him after the catastrophe of \\'Ishtar,\\' noted Robert Heyl, \\nowner of the Wyoming Theater Co. in Torrington, Wyo. \\n\\n\\nOne lone dissenter was Otto Settele, owner of Rosa Theaters in Waupaca, Wis., \\nwho was hoping Tom Hanks will win. \"Hanks is a very popular star right now,\" he \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\nIs that the only reason? \\n\\n\\n\"Well,\" Settele admitted, laughing, \"I\\'m coming out with the \\'burbs\\' on Friday, \\nand a Hanks Oscar could help business.\" \\n\\n\\nOther ShoWest conventionerrs, however, had academy politics and not their \\nbottom line in mind when they predicted a Glenn Close or Jodie Foster victory \\nfor best actress. \\n\\n\\n\"Glenn Close will get it because she should have gotten it for \\'Fatal \\nAttraction\\' and the academy always apologizes the next year,\" explained \\nCarpenter. \\n\\n\\nBut Bradford Bills believes the academy will honor Foster \"because it was a \\nrole that stretched her beyond what she\\'s done before. And I think they would \\nlike to see her win to encourage her to go on and do bigger and better things.\" \\n\\n\\nMost conventioneers thought Sigourney Weaver deserved an award -- but couldn\\'t \\nmake up their minds if she deserved it in the best actress or best supporting \\nactress category. \\n\\n\\nMelanie Griffith\\'s performance in \\'Working Girl\\' was another favorite although \\nsome thought the film itself too small in scope for an award. \\n\\n\\n\"She deserves a lot of credit,\" maintained Ted Conley. \"But, knowing how the \\nacademy works, I just think it\\'s a little bit before her time.\" \\n\\n\\nAnd, speaking of academy politics, most ShoWest attendees agreed with the \\ninclusion of Martin Scorsese in the best director category for \"The Last \\nTemptation of Christ.\" Even those whose theaters had decided not to show the \\nmovie because of the controversy it had created, like Doug Kinney, manager of \\nthe Douglas Theater in Lincoln, Neb. \\n\\n\\n\"I was glad to see it (nominated),\" Kinney said. \"I thought that was a nice \\nlittle touch.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJanuary 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDGA NOMINATIONS FURTHER MUDDLE OSCAR RACE; \\n\\n\\nMOVIES: DIRECTORS GUILD REMEMBERS SPRING/SUMMER FILMS FOR ITS TOP AWARD BUT \\nFORGETS SPIKE LEE AND PAUL MAZURSKY. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ad line that Universal Pictures has been using in its Oscar campaign for \\nPhil Alden Robinson\\'s \"Field of Dreams,\" a fantasy baseball-theme picture \\nreleased last spring, is \"Remember the feeling.\" Enough members of the \\nDirectors Guild of America remembered to give Robinson the feeling of being a \\nnominee for the DGA\\'s 1989 best-director award. \\n\\n\\nEnough members also remembered \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"When Harry Met Sally,\" \\ntwo early summer releases, to put their directors -- Peter Weir and Rob Reiner \\n-- on a list that also included previous DGA winners Woody Allen (\"Crimes and \\nMisdemeanors\") and Oliver Stone (\"Born on the Fourth of July\"). \\n\\n\\nWeir was a previous DGA nominee in 1985 for \"Witness.\" Reiner was nominated for \\nthe 1986 \"Stand By Me.\" Allen won the award in 1977 for \"Annie Hall\" and was a \\nsubsequent nominee for both \"Manhattan\" in 1979 and \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" in \\n1986. Stone won in 1987 for \"Platoon.\" \\n\\n\\nThe DGA, the bulk of whose 9,000 members are not feature-film directors, has \\nhad a spotty record of presaging the full list of nominations made by the \\ndirectors branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. But it has \\nbeen nearly perfect in aligning its winner with the eventual Oscar winner. Only \\nthree times in the 41-year history of the DGA awards has the guild\\'s winner not \\ngone on to win the Academy Award as well. \\n\\n\\nFor weeks, veteran Oscar watchers have been calling this one of the most \\nwide-open races in years, and Tuesday\\'s announcement, made by 1988 winner Barry \\nLevinson (\"Rain Man\"), did little to put it into focus. Previously honored \\ndirectors Spike Lee (winner of the L.A. critics\\' best-director award for \"Do \\nthe Right Thing\"), Paul Mazursky (the New York winner for \"Enemies, a Love \\nStory\"), Kenneth Branagh (the National Board of Review\\'s pick for \"Henry V\"), \\nand Gus Van Sant (\"Drugstore Cowboy,\" selected by the National Society of Film \\nCritics) were all left off the DGA list. \\n\\n\\nA number of other directors of well-reviewed films who were overlooked by the \\nDGA (\"Driving Miss Daisy\\'s\" Bruce Beresford, \"The War of the Roses\" \\' Danny \\nDeVito, \"Glory\\'s\" Ed Zwick, \"sex, lies, and videotape\\'s\" Steven Soderbergh, \\n\"Music Box\\'s\" Costa-Gavras) are still in the running for Oscars. \\n\\n\\nOf this year\\'s DGA slate, only Oliver Stone seems certain to be among the \\nacademy\\'s best-director nominees. Oscar nominations will be announced Feb. 14; \\nballoting closes Friday. \\n\\n\\nIn the meantime, the DGA nominations underscore the changing release patterns \\nof major studios and undermine the conventional wisdom that films released \\nbefore the fall are forgotten by winter. \\n\\n\\n\"Field of Dreams,\" the story of a corn farmer who builds a baseball field for \\nhis father\\'s post-World War I idols, then watches the flanneled ghosts play \\nball, opened in March, a month that had traditionally been better for teen-age \\nhigh-jinks movies than for those aimed at adults. It played all the way through \\nthe most competitive summer in history and grossed more than $62 million. \\n\\n\\nThe movie seemed to strike a nerve with audiences, especially men tweaked by \\nmemories of their own relationships with their fathers, and enjoyed the kind of \\nword-of-mouth that made such films as \"Chariots of Fire\" and \"Peggy Sue Got \\nMarried\" easy to remember at awards time. \\n\\n\\n\"Dead Poets Society\" fits the same mold. The movie, about a free-spirited \\nEnglish teacher at a conservative prep school, was a risky summer entry by \\nDisney\\'s Touchstone division but easily held its own and has grossed more than \\n$94 million. The DGA nomination bodes well for both Weir and the film\\'s star, \\nRobin Williams, in the Oscar race. \\n\\n\\nRob Reiner\\'s \"When Harry Met Sally,\" a romantic comedy about a couple who seem \\nto prove the notion that friendships between men and women are sooner or later \\nsubverted by sexual attraction, was an instant box-office hit, propelled by the \\nmost talked-about scene of the year (Meg Ryan\\'s faked orgasm in Katz Deli) and \\nhas taken in $92 million. \\n\\n\\nWoody Allen\\'s \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" divided critics and audiences but found \\nenough fans within the DGA. A funny-sad meditation on the relativity of sin in \\nGod\\'s eyes, it has faced the usual resistance from moviegoers to Allen films -- \\nparticularly those that veer into the epistemological zone. \"Crimes and \\nMisdemeanors\" has grossed just $17 million and was pretty much ignored by \\ncritics groups. \\n\\n\\nStone\\'s \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" adapted from the autobiography of Vietnam \\nveteran Ron Kovic, is on a roll at the box office (it grossed more than $30 \\nmillion during its first month in release) and seems the odds-on favorite to \\ndominate the Oscars. Stone is that rare film maker who, in one of Hollywood\\'s \\nmost timid eras, has managed to both make films with heavy social themes and \\nturn studio executives lightheaded with their box-office success. \\n\\n\\nThe DGA\\'s nominations figure to be more populist than the academy, which in \\nturn figures to be more populist than critics. There are 270 feature-film \\ndirectors in the academy\\'s directors branch, while the DGA membership includes \\ndirectors of film and TV dramas and their assistants, directors of TV news and \\nsports programs, unit production managers and stage production managers. \\n\\n\\nThe DGA will announce its nominees in TV categories next week. All 9,000 \\nmembers vote on the final ballot and the winners will be announced by Levinson \\nat the guild\\'s annual dinner March 10 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly \\nHills. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n920514\\n\\n\\nFT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (2): Virtuous circle rewarded with\\npublic support - Stephen Fidler looks at how inflation has been tamed\\n\\n\\nWHEN President Carlos Menem assumed office, Argentina was in a frenzy of\\nhyperinflation.\\nIn that month, July 1989, retail prices rose nearly 200 per cent. At this\\nlevel, commerce grinds to a halt. Simple transactions become impossible\\nbecause people have no idea at what price they will be able to replace what\\nthey have sold.\\nHyperinflation threatened again in early 1990. Since then, the inflation\\ntrend has been dramatically down. Last year, prices rose 84 per cent,\\ncompared with over 1,300 per cent in 1990 and almost 5,000 per cent the year\\nbefore. This year, inflation will probably be significantly below 20 per\\ncent.\\nFor this brief insight into relative economic stability, the Argentine\\npeople have been grateful. As voters, they have responded with support for\\nthose who back the government's economic programme. As savers, they have\\nbegun to bring back capital: they accounted for much of the estimated\\nDollars 5bn that flowed into Argentina in 1991. As consumers, they have\\nstarted to spend, encouraged by the emergence of what for Argentines is an\\nunusual service: consumer credit.\\nAs a result, while some sectors have suffered, there is no sense of overall\\neconomic austerity. Gross domestic product rose some 5-6 per cent last year,\\nwith employment rising 3 per cent and industrial production up 20 per cent.\\nThis year growth could be higher: perhaps 7-8 per cent, according to Mr\\nDomingo Cavallo, the economy minister.\\nThe economy appears to have entered a virtuous cycle. This dates back almost\\nentirely to a law, the brainchild of Mr Cavallo who took office in January\\n1991, that went into effect on the inauspicious date of April Fool's Day\\nlast year. The convertibility law turned the central bank into a currency\\nboard. It fixed the Argentine currency to the US dollar and only allows the\\ncentral bank to issue local currency when backed by inflows of dollars to\\nthe central bank. (The dollar was set at 10,000 australs. This January, the\\ngovernment renamed its currency the peso and made one peso the equivalent of\\nUSDollars 1.)\\nThis law halted the Argentine inflation machine - by which the central bank\\nprinted money to cover a budget deficit estimated to have reached 14 per\\ncent of GDP at its worst in mid-1989.\\nIt also made it imperative that the budget deficit was kept in check. The\\ngovernment has managed to do this by raising tax revenues, mainly through\\nthe imposition of an effective value added tax, and abolishing subsidies to\\npublic sector enterprises. The government shrank its overall budget deficit,\\nincluding privatisation receipts, to 0.6 per cent of GDP last year, and a\\nsmall surplus is promised for the next two years.\\nA central part of the programme has been the privatisation of the\\nloss-making public enterprises. This was envisaged in a state reform act\\nwhich passed into law in 1989 and predated Mr Cavallo.\\nThe Menem administration also moved quickly to bring down tariffs and\\nabolish almost all quotas on imports, turning Argentina very rapidly from\\none of the most protected economies on earth to one of the most open. Late\\nlast year, the reforms were supplemented by decrees abolishing large swathes\\nof the regulation which has hobbled private enterprise.\\nHowever, 60 years of state controls have produced a perverse economic system\\nthat will take more than a year to dismantle. Mr Cavallo, most of whose team\\ncame with him from the economic research group he founded, Fundacion\\nMediterranea, admits that there is still much to do.\\nAccording to Mr Juan Llach, planning secretary in the economy ministry, the\\nfollowing are among the priorities:\\nCompleting Argentina's dramatic privatisation programme (see separate\\narticle), which will remove Dollars 700m annually or 1/2 percentage point of\\nGDP from the budget deficit.\\nConcluding Argentina's deal with foreign bank creditors. The government's\\naim is to complete the exchange of concessional bonds for loans by November\\nor December this year. While the Brady agreement has been criticised\\ninternally for being too generous to the banks - interest payments to\\ncommercial banks will roughly double to about Dollars 130m monthly - the\\ncountry will stop building up interest arrears to the banks. The deal is\\nlikely to improve the country's access to foreign capital markets.\\nWinning congressional approval for reform of the social security system, an\\nimportant contributor to the fiscal deficit. The aim will be to move towards\\na mixed system, allowing the creation of private pension funds It would also\\nput the state sector on a sounder financial footing.\\nArgentina has a higher proportion of old people than other Latin American\\ncountries (apart from Uruguay): as a result its state pension bill has been\\nhigh. Argentina's monthly pension bill is about Dollars 800m, 7 per cent of\\nGDP, compared with the 1 per cent spent by Mexico.\\nWhile Argentina's pension system is in balance on a cash basis, old people\\ndo not get the pensions they are promised by the state. This builds up every\\nmonth a notional deficit with pensioners. The ministry wants to lower the\\nentitlement, perhaps to Dollars 150 a month, but to make sure everybody gets\\nthis amount.\\nThe private pensions, to which everyone under 45 would pay 10 per cent of\\nsalary, are also seen as playing an important role in the development of the\\ncapital markets, as they have in Chile.\\nReforming the labour laws. These help contribute to high labour costs in\\nArgentina. Reform has several facets, one of the most important of which is\\nthe law on social medicine. This obliges trade unions to provide medical\\ntreatment for members. While the system gives access to medical coverage to\\na large sector of the population, it is seen as costly and inefficient.\\nThe idea is for the state to provide a basic health service, but allow\\npeople to opt for private medical care, which the vide. The ministry is also\\nseeking to tackle the laws of collective bargaining to allow for a much more\\ndecentralised system of wage bargaining. Further tax reform would reduce\\ntaxes on labour, which increase labour costs by up to 50 per cent.\\nMore changes in the regulatory system. The government will seek further\\nderegulation, for example, by inducing Argentina's 24 provinces to\\nderegulate in areas where they have jurisdiction such as in the setting of\\nprofessional fees. In other areas, where natural monopolies are being\\nprivatised, the state will seek to establish effective regulatory regimes.\\nThe efforts by the ministry to establish an overall budget for the\\ngovernment, divided into ministries is also important. In January, Mr\\ncavallo delivered to Congress and secured passage of the first budget since\\n1953.\\nFor some time to come, if the government manages to preserve relatively low\\ninflation, Mr Cavallo's programme should retain his popularity. However, low\\ninflation will not secure eternal gratitude from Argentine voters. There\\nwill probably emerge in time dissatisfaction about the ability of the state\\nto provide the social goods such as health and education which fall into its\\nmuch reduced remit.\\nIn the longer term, growth is the key to Argentina's remaining in the\\nvirtuous economic circle. Given the financial straitjacket that Mr Cavallo\\nis constructing around the public sector, the key to the long-term success\\nof the programme has to be private sector investment. This is why Mr Cavallo\\nhas placed a high priority on normalising relations with foreign creditors\\nand why he wants to abolish the rules that inflate Argentine labour costs.\\nPrivate investment will depend on the world being convinced that Argentina\\nis a place where investment can be made under fixed and transparent rules:\\nsomething which cannot be said yet to have been achieved, in part because of\\na lack of trust in the judicial system.\\nSuch investment is also sensitive to economic confidence which can be upset.\\nFor the moment, the fixed exchange rate regime has given Argentines\\nconfidence to bring their money home. But a clumsy adjustment of that regime\\ncould damage confidence badly. It seems almost certain - despite average\\nmonthly consumer price inflation of around 2 per cent in the first four\\nmonths of the year - that Mr Cavallo can maintain the fixed rate for 1992.\\nThe picture varies, but many manufacturers say that the combination of\\ntariff reductions and the relatively strong peso has left the cost of\\nimports little changed. The government emphasises too that wholesale price\\nrises are running at much lower levels than retail inflation - an average\\n0.6 per cent monthly in the first quarter.\\nHowever, if rises in retail prices lead to upward pressure on wages, then\\nthe competitive position of Argentine exporters will be damaged. This will\\nin turn increase the pressure for a devaluation of the exchange rate. The\\ngovernment in the meantime is hoping that deregulation can shake up the\\nservices and oligopolistic retail sector, to put downward pressure on retail\\nprices. Meanwhile, the inflows of capital represent a two-edged sword in the\\ninflation fight: they make it easier to continue the exchange rate regime\\nbut also cause an expansion in the money supply which puts upward pressure\\non prices.\\nMost damaging to confidence in the short term would probably be the\\ndisappearance from office of Mr Cavallo. He and President Menem are widely\\nreported to have differences, but know they need each other. The economy\\nminister denies suggestions he has ever threatened to resign, and says that\\nany fears that he and the president would part company in a damaging way\\n'underestimates me and underestimates President Menem.'\\nMr Cavallo is widely considered to need another 18 months to complete his\\nprogramme.

            "{'text': \"\\n930527\\n\\n\\nFT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Argentina (2): Breakneck pace / Review of the\\neconomy\\n\\n\\nARGENTINA is the latest blue-eyed boy of the Washington international\\nfinancial institutions. Economic reform has been at breakneck pace and is\\ndelivering growth - nearly 9 per cent annually over the last two years. The\\ngovernment's fiscal house has been put in order: tax revenues have increased\\nthreefold since 1989 and the government is running a surplus helped in part\\nby Latin America's most radical privatisation programme.\\nThis has happened not under a government where opposition is repressed or\\nmuted by the political system, as in Chile during the 1980s and in Mexico,\\nbut in a relatively democratic context. Indeed, some people inside and\\noutside the country are beginning to talk of an Argentine economic miracle.\\nOn the face of it, the figures on the accompanying chart suggest Argentina\\nis doing well even when compared with the region's other commonly-cited\\neconomic 'success stories'.\\nThe main threat to the miracle, many people believe, is the lack of\\nsustainability of the policy that has fixed the exchange rate to the dollar\\nsince April 1991. Argentine inflation is coming down rapidly - consumer\\nprices rose 17.5 per cent in the year to December and 11.7 per cent in the\\nyear to April - but prices are still rising at a rate which puts Argentine\\nindustry under severe competitive pressure.\\nEvidence is said to be visible in a current account deficit which widened\\nrapidly last year to just under 4 per cent of gross domestic product,\\nincreasing the economy's dependency on capital inflows from abroad.\\nMr Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister who tied the peso to the dollar\\n(and secured a law which prevented the central bank from printing money\\nexcept when backed by foreign currency inflows), says devaluing the peso\\nwould be 'madness'. The competitive advantages of doing so would evaporate\\nas inflationary expectations, which are highly sensitive to the exchange\\nrate in Argentina, rose.\\nHe argues that if foreign owners of capital are worried about Argentina's\\nexchange rate, they are not showing it. Capital continued to flow into the\\ncountry during the first four months of 1993.\\nFurthermore, the effect of the exchange rate on the competitive position of\\nArgentine industry is being exaggerated. Lower tariffs on imports have\\nhelped to contain the cost of industry inputs - wholesale prices rose only\\n3.2 per cent last year.\\nMr Cavallo's mind is on other things besides the exchange rate. At the start\\nof the month his ministry issued its plans for further reform and economic\\nprojections until the end of the current administration's term of office in\\n1995.\\nThey project 43 per cent growth in GDP for the six years of the Menem term,\\nby the end of which inflation - as measured by the mean of consumer and\\nwholesale prices - will have fallen to less than 4 per cent and 1.6m new\\njobs will have been created. The economy, Mr Cavallo says, has grown by 18\\nper cent in the past two years and 670,000 jobs have been created. Inflation\\nwhen Mr Menem took office was 200 per cent a month.\\nHis objectives for the future will lay 'a strong emphasis on savings,\\ninvestment and jobs', he said in an interview:\\nSavings: Huge tax evasion used to mean the incentives for savings were\\nineffective. The government's fight against evasion of its value added tax\\nhas proved successful and 600,000 companies have been brought into the net.\\nNow, the government plans to turn its attention to fighting evasion of\\nincome taxes, attempting to bring 2m people, including professionals and\\nself-employed, into the income tax net and to ensure they pay social\\nsecurity. This would help raise the domestic savings rate to 20 per cent by\\n1995 from about 17 per cent now, reducing reliance on foreign savings.\\nAccording to the government's projections, the dependence on external\\ncapital peaked last year and will decline steadily until 2000 when it will\\nfall to zero.\\nInvestment: The government has already provided help for buyers of capital\\ngoods, exempting them from a 10 per cent import tax on imports and provides\\ndomestic producers of capital goods with tax rebates on what they sell.\\nEmployment: There are plans to cut labour taxes. These cuts would deepen\\nwith increasing distance from Buenos Aires, to encourage companies to move\\ninto areas which have so far seen little economic growth. Incentives would\\nbe given to provincial governments to follow central government in\\nsimplifying its tax structure. The government is also encouraging the\\nstate-owned Banco de la Nacion to provide cheaper credit for small\\nbusinesses, farmers and fishermen to encourage restructuring in these areas.\\nMr Cavallo denies that what is taking shape is an industrial policy. He has\\nno bureaucrat in his office working on these issues. 'We still have no\\nindustrial policy that helps specific sectors. It's not that we think it's\\ngood or bad. It's because the government doesn't have the ability to do\\nthis.'\\nThe aim is to lay down a programme for the remaining two years of the\\ngovernment and invite the opposition to come up with its own. The minister\\nsays he wants to increase transparency of economic policy and reduce\\nuncertainty about a political transition.\\nIn a recent magazine interview, Mr Cavallo not only underlined that the\\nconvertibility plan would be maintained without either him or Mr Menem. He\\nfurther said that leading economists of the opposition Radical Party  - such\\nas Mr Adolfo Sturzenegger and Mr Ricardo Lopez Murphy - would be capable of\\nrunning the economy very well.\\nThere are those who believe Mr Cavallo is taking some risks this year, by\\npursuing a policy which will avoid recession but heighten the risk of\\ninflation. Mr Miguel Broda, who runs aneconomic analysis company, says Mr\\nCavallo has taken a number of measures over the last half year apparently\\nintended to avoid a slowing of growth and raise both demand and supply.\\nSince September 1992 the government has increased social security payments,\\ngiven value added tax rebates to exporters and reduced taxes on diesel,\\nannounced increased government expenditures, cut bank reserve requirements\\nand given tax incentives to producers and buyers of capital goods.\\nFurthermore, it has promised to use the proceeds from the sale of the state\\noil company to clear the government's debts to pensioners. This latter move\\nwill have a strong impact on consumption, Mr Broda predicts.\\nThis could mean that growth, instead of slowing down to 2-3 per cent this\\nyear, will stay above 5 per cent, making realistic the government projection\\nof 6.5 per cent. The gamble is on inflation: many Argentine companies are\\nalready running at full capacity. Industrial production has increased 34 per\\ncent since the convertibility plan was introduced and is already running,\\nsays Mr Broda, at the highest level in Argentine history.\\nMr Broda suggests that Mr Cavallo is seeking strong economic growth this\\nyear in order to boost tax revenues. This will allow him to reduce taxes on\\nlabour.\\nHe says Mr Cavallo is doing this because 1992 was a lost year for the\\ngovernment in terms of advancing labour and social security reforms, both of\\nwhich are meant to improve flexibility of the labour market and lower the\\nnon-wage costs of hiring labour. Mr Cavallo says both reforms will be in\\nplace by the end of the year.\\nThe social security and pensions reform is with the senate, having passed\\nthe house of deputies with some modifications. These allow, for example, for\\npeople to stay within a state system if they want. The fact that private\\npensions will not be compulsory has worried some of the reform's supporters\\nwho see it diluting the reforms's beneficial impact. Mr Cavallo says he is\\nsatisfied: 'We wanted a perfect law. Now it's not 100 per cent but it's a\\nvery good law even with the modifications.'\\nMeanwhile, although the labour law might not be introduced to Congress\\nbefore the October congressional elections, it would be in place by next\\nyear. While there is evidence that some Argentine industry is responding to\\nlow inflation and a strong exchange rate by restructuring, the question is\\nwhether it will be enough; rises in wages have been eroding some of the\\nproductivity gains. At his economic analysis company, Mr Broda wonders aloud\\nwhether Mr Cavallo is betting too high: he now says there is a 50 per cent\\nchance that the current parity between the dollar and the peso will still be\\nin place by the end of 1994.

            "{'text': \"\\n940823\\n\\n\\nFT  23 AUG 94 / Personal View: Peg is no panacea for hyper-inflation\\n\\n\\nThere has been much discussion lately of how effective a pegged ex-change\\nrate can be in stabilising the value of a currency (Financial Times,\\nEconomic Viewpoint: 'No going back to Bretton Woods', July 28).\\nPegged rates can help with stabilisation and have been central components of\\nanti-inflation strategies in many instances, but they cannot do it alone;\\nthe right supporting conditions are also necessary.\\nSuch conditions cannot be assumed automatically to accompany the adoption of\\na fixed-rate regime. This is why the record of such regimes, such as the\\nmany stabilisation plans in Latin America and elsewhere, in the 1980s and\\n1990s includes failures as well as successes.\\nAt the same time, successful stabilisation has been achieved without pegging\\nthe exchange rate. It is important to review the lessons from such diverse\\nexperiences, several of which are discussed in the May 1994 edition of the\\nIMF's World Economic Outlook.\\nStrict financial discipline is critical for successful stabilisation, with\\nor without a pegged exchange rate. Large fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits\\nare a fundamental driving force behind the excessive monetary expansion that\\nsustains high inflation. In high-inflation countries, attempts to stabilise\\nprices without attacking the fiscal deficits have, at best, only temporarily\\nsucceeded.\\nTo be sure, pegging the exchange rate can encourage financial discipline,\\nbut this effect should not be exaggerated.\\nThe costs of failure under a pegged regime are high. Fiscally unsound\\nprogrammes that have relied on a fixed exchange rate - and, in many\\ninstances, on incomes policies as well - have achieved only a temporary\\nreduction in inflation. When such programmes eventually fail, inflation\\ncomes back with a vengeance.\\nDuring the second half of the 1980s, for example, Argentina and Brazil went\\nthrough a succession of failed exchange-rate-based programmes, with\\ninflation reaching a higher plateau after each failure. Failed programmes,\\nwhether exchange-rate-based or not, erode the credibility of future\\nstabilisation efforts, increase the public debt, may have a high cost in\\nterms of international reserve losses, and increase the difficulty of\\neventually attaining stabilisation.\\nUsing the exchange rate as the nominal anchor has been most successful\\nagainst hyper-inflation - when rigidities in domestic prices and wages and\\nbackward-looking indexation usually disappear. Most prices are quoted in\\nforeign currency. Hence, fixing the exchange rate can immediately stabilise\\nprices in domestic currency. This explains why in most successful\\nstabilisations inflation has come down virtually overnight.\\nAn important problem, however, is fixing the exchange rate at the right\\nlevel, a particularly difficult task in economies in transition or others\\nwith widespread price distortions. If the rate is fixed at too high a level,\\ncompetitiveness in foreign trade may be sacrificed and, with it, confidence\\nin the currency. If the rate is too low, far from reining in inflation it\\nmay give it an additional boost.\\nPegged exchange rates have also been successful in stabilising economies\\nwith a history of high, but relatively stable, inflation. However, in these\\ncases widespread indexation in goods and financial markets imparts a high\\ndegree of inertia to inflation.\\nFixing either the level or the rate of change of the exchange rate does not\\nusually have an immediate effect on inflation, thus leading to real\\nappreciation and often unsustainable trade deficits. Therefore, incomes\\npolicies have sometimes been used to break the wage-price spiral, as in the\\nsuccessful Mexican and Israeli plans, and in Argentina structural reforms\\nsuch as the elimination of indexation were used.\\nCurrency stabilisation may occur even without a sizeable cushion of reserves\\nor abundant official foreign financing. External financing may be important\\nas a signal of international support, not least in helping to make\\nstabilisation packages politically feasible.\\nIn some cases, a sizeable reserve cushion has also been useful in\\nreinforcing the credibility of the peg. However, experience shows, most\\nrecently in Argentina, that large amounts of official foreign financing are\\nnot strictly essential to support an exchange rate peg when the domestic\\nfinancial situation is brought under control. Also, countries such as\\nBolivia and Peru floated their currencies and were able to maintain currency\\nstability without major official external financing. The potential for\\nprivate capital inflows may in any case overshadow the need for official\\nfinancing.\\nWhat the past teaches us is that an exchange rate anchor is considerably\\nless than a panacea for stabilisation, though the IMF has appropriately\\nsupported its use as part of a credible policy package in, for example, the\\nformer Czechoslovakia, Estonia and Poland.\\nBut if the other conditions for currency stabilisation, especially fiscal\\nconsolidation, are not met, an exchange rate anchor will fail, and may make\\nthe outcome worse than if it had never been introduced.\\nIts main use is in enhancing the credibility of an otherwise viable policy\\npackage, especially in hyper-inflationary conditions, though even with such\\na package it may be useful, but not necessary.\\nFor this reason, the IMF takes a pragmatic view of pegged exchange rates,\\nconsidering their use as but one possible tool in recommending an\\nappropriate policy package to help members reduce inflation and restore the\\nvalue of, and confidence in, their currencies.\\nThe author is the director of external relations, International Monetary\\nFund\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

'My preconceptions turned out\\nto be a million miles away from reality.'\\nMr Johnson, managing director of Ryobi Aluminium Casting, a Japanese-owned\\nautomotive castings manufacturer, is one of the small but growing number of\\nexpatriate businessmen sent to Northern Ireland to manage companies. He\\nleaves shortly for another job in the US, where he will stoutly defend the\\nreputation of a place he says is damaged by distorted reporting and too\\noften viewed through a prism of ignorance.\\nHe says: 'We've made good friends. My daughter has picked up the accent,\\nthough I don't know how it will go down in South Carolina. We'll be back for\\nholidays and, for the rest of our lives, we'll be watching what happens\\nhere.'\\nA posting to Ulster might not be at the top of many executives' gift list,\\nbut Mr Johnson arrived with his wife and seven-year-old daughter during\\nChristmas 1990 to take charge of Ryobi's Pounds 16m investment. His company\\nhad been drawn to the province by the prospect of lucrative contracts to\\nsupply Ford of Germany and by a range of incentives arguably as attractive\\nas any in Europe.\\nYesterday's announcement by Benelux adds another name to the register of\\ncompanies which have already decided that Northern Ireland's reputation as a\\nwar-torn trouble spot is outweighed by its commercial advantages.\\nEstimates suggest that about 55,000 people in the province are directly\\nemployed by overseas companies. In the past year alone inward investors have\\ncreated more than 1,600 jobs and, since last summer, foreign companies have\\nannounced new investments worth more than Pounds 100m.\\nMore are in the pipeline. A Taiwanese floppy-disk manufacturer is poised to\\ninvest Pounds 13m in a new west Belfast factory while a Taiwanese textile\\ngroup wants to build a Pounds 160m plant that will involve the biggest\\ninward investment in the UK for five years. The UK is seeking European Union\\napproval for the deal, which could mean employment for 2,000 people.\\nThe jobs are badly needed in a part of the UK with higher-than-average\\nunemployment and ghettos where the jobless outnumber those in work. When\\nRyobi advertised for its first nine skilled operators, more than 150\\nqualified people applied.\\nSome US companies are investing in the province - particularly in and around\\nLondonderry - but many remain wary about putting money into what they see as\\na high-risk commercial zone.\\nThe pace is being set by Far East companies, which do not appear to be so\\neasily troubled by the province's international image. 'If you are a Seoul\\nbusinessmen, you are well used to having Sam missiles pointed at you,' says\\none Belfast-based location consultant.\\nFor Ryobi, the province beat several other European locations because of the\\navailability of highly skilled workers and a range of grants which provided\\nabout 25 per cent of start-up costs. The highly automated plant in\\nCarrickfergus on the edge of Belfast employs 44 people and, given an\\nimprovement in the European vehicle market, could eventually give work to\\n250.\\nYet Mr Johnson's bosses from Japan still needed some persuading. 'They\\napproved all the figures but were understandably very nervous about the\\npolitical situation,' he says. 'Two board members came over and we drove\\nthem around the best and the worst that Belfast has to offer. They realised\\nthat, for most people in most places, life was no different to anywhere\\nelse. We were told to go ahead.'\\nRyobi, like other foreign investors, has not been touched by the Troubles\\nand stays out of politics.\\nAs for Mr Johnson's own thoughts as he prepares to leave: 'I would not dare\\nsuggest I know the answer and won't preach pessimism or optimism. I am sure\\nit will take some while to sort out. But there are so many good people here,\\none day it must be solved.'\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n921021\\n\\n\\nFT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of European Business Locations (6): Geographically\\nhandicapped - Ireland\\n\\n\\nLOCATED on the north-west edge of Europe, the island of Ireland suffers a\\ngeographic disadvantage not shared by most other EC regions. To move\\nproducts to the main population centres of Europe requires one, and often\\ntwo, sea crossings. Bad weather can disrupt sailing schedules of the ferry\\nservices, and for companies working on 'just-in-time' inventory control,\\nthis can signify unexpected and possibly unacceptable delays in delivery\\ntimes.\\nNonetheless, this has not prevented more than 1,000 foreign companies\\nestablishing manufacturing bases to service the EC market in the Irish\\nRepublic and scores more in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years. Leading\\nindustrial names in diverse manufacturing sectors such as Coca-Cola, Apple\\nComputers, Motorola, Intel Corporation, Fruit-of-the-Loom, and Microsoft,\\nhave all chosen to establish continental-scale production facilities in\\nIreland.\\nThe shopping list of grants and incentives on offer are those that can be\\nexpected in most regions throughout Europe seeking to attract mobile inward\\ninvestment. Capital grants, training, R & D and marketing grants, advance\\nfactory facilities, and tax incentives are available in both parts of the\\nisland, although these vary considerably from project to project. A standard\\ncorporation tax rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing until the year 2010,\\nis an attraction for many companies to the Republic, as is the government's\\ncommitment to a stable exchange rate policy and the country's earliest\\npossible inclusion in a single currency area within the EC.\\nImprovements in telecommunications on both sides of the border have\\nfacilitated the development of service industries especially in\\n'back-office' data processing in the public and private sectors. Northern\\nIreland now claims to have one of the most advanced fibre-optic\\ntelecommunications networks anywhere in Europe, with all trunk routes\\nconverted to the new technology. Practically any location in the province\\ncan have special fibre-optic cable laid to the office or factory door at\\nreasonable cost, signifying that all present and planned technologies,\\nincluding High Definition TV (HDTV), Integrated Services Data Networks\\n(ISDN) and ultra-high speed data communications will be available through\\nthe network.\\nSimilar developments are taking place in the Republic, although the\\nfibre-optic network is not yet widespread.\\nOn both sides of the border, schools and universities give a high priority\\nto training in information technology, resulting in well-trained workforces\\nwith high levels of computer literacy. High-technology and high value-added\\nindustries such as electronics and software development have thus been\\nattracted to Ireland, as have the 'back-office' service industries looking\\nfor lower-cost locations and lower staff turnovers.\\nMany employers have found that staff loyalty is much greater in Ireland than\\nin large urban centres such as London or New York, and that emigration in\\nsearch of higher salaries is often not the preferred option for most\\nemployees.\\nIndeed, the quality of life is widely considered to be an important location\\nfactor for many companies conscious of staff morale. The clean environment\\nand easy access to the countryside and coastline, offers recreational\\nopportunities that are not easily matched in other parts of Europe.\\nThe transport infrastructure still shows deficiencies in the Republic in\\nspite of large infusions of cash from Brussels over the past decade.\\nTransport planning has the appearance of being piecemeal and overly\\ninfluenced by powerful lobby groups at local and national level, leading to\\nthe construction of little-used dual carriageways in locations such as\\nShannon on the west coast, while main trunk routes still wind their way\\nthrough the high streets of market towns just a few miles outside the\\ncapital.\\nA motorway ring route around Dublin is unlikely to be completed before the\\nend of the decade, while planners still appear unable to decide whether to\\ngo ahead with building a light-rail transport system for the capital, in\\nspite of predictions of an exponential worsening of traffic congestion in\\nDublin in the immediate years ahead.\\nNorthern Ireland, in contrast, has a well-developed road and rail network,\\nand port facilities which are envied in the Republic to the extent that many\\nroad hauliers in the south prefer to use Belfast and Larne rather than\\nDublin, as their sea route to the UK mainland.\\nNorthern Ireland, however, continues to suffer from its 'image problem', as\\na result of the political violence which this year claimed its 3,000th\\nvictim since 1969. Although only very few people and firms are directly\\naffected by the violence, the Industrial Development Board (IDB) recognises\\nit is an uphill task to convince foreign companies to risk their employees\\nor investments in the province.\\nIndustrial policy is undergoing a thorough reappraisal on both sides of the\\nborder. Economic efficiency is being increasingly stressed in the use of\\ngrant-aid for industrial developments as opposed to simple job-creation\\ncriteria.\\nThe IDB in Northern Ireland spends some Pounds 80-Pounds 100m a year in\\nfinancial assistance to industry, but this year 'the rise in unemployment in\\nJuly alone exceeded the combined annual job promotions of the IDB and the\\nLedu (a small-enterprise promotion body) in 1991-92', according to the\\nautumn economic review of the Northern Ireland Economic Council (Niec). The\\nNiec says that the 46 per cent fall in job promotions over the past year, is\\nlargely due to the IDB's new efficiency criteria but notes that the\\n'implementation of the new strategy was causing a significant degree of\\nconfusion both in local industry and within the development agencies\\nthemselves as to how the 'backing winners' approach was being implemented'.\\nIn the Republic, where IPounds 130m is spent per year in industrial\\npromotion, the government announced last month that in future it is to give\\ngreater emphasis to the promotion of Irish indigenous industry. This follows\\ncriticisms made in an industrial policy review published earlier this year,\\nthat Ireland has become over-dependent on overseas-owned industrial\\nenterprises in developing its industrial base. 'The balance needs to be\\nredressed to achieve greater output and employment growth in the indigenous\\nsector. Existing policies and promotional arrangements have not succeeded in\\ndoing this,' said Mr Des O'Malley, the industry and commerce minister.\\nThis does not mean that new inward investment will not still be welcomed in\\nIreland, but it will have to compete more closely with Irish industry for\\ngrants and may be subject to tighter performance targets.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n940915\\n\\n\\nFT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (6): Invisible barriers start to\\nfall - North/South trade / Trade links are expected to be substantially\\nimproved over the next five years as they are a priority in the Republic's\\nIRPounds 7bn National Development Plan\\n\\n\\nTrade between Northern Ireland and its nearest neighbour, the Republic of\\nIreland, is abnormally low - and skewed heavily in favour of the Republic.\\nNorthern Ireland's exports to the Republic represent just under eight per\\ncent of the total. Goods and services flowing the other way represent about\\nsix per cent of the Republic's total exports.\\nThe north's main exports to the Republic are live animals and food products,\\nincluding beverages, which accounted for around 40 per cent of the Pounds\\n468m exported in 1992. Other leading exports include fertiliser, textiles\\nand clothing.\\nFood products and live animals account for around 46 per cent of Northern\\nIreland's imports from the Republic, which were Pounds 825m in 1992.\\nManufactured goods, including chemicals, industrial machinery and road\\nvehicles, accounted for 47 per cent of imports.\\nThe reasons for the low level of trade are both infrastructural and\\nhistorical. The antipathy of certain parts of the Northern Irish business\\ncommunity to trading with the Republic, and the apprehension of companies in\\nthe Republic about trading in Northern Ireland, are widely acknowledged, but\\nunquantifiable.\\nCurrent political developments may go a long way towards breaking down these\\ninvisible trade barriers and complement the efforts made in recent years to\\novercome the tangible, infrastructural barriers.\\nOver the last three years the two leading business organisations in Ireland,\\nthe Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, and the Irish\\nBusiness and Employers Confederation (Ibec) in the Republic, have undertaken\\na number of joint initiatives aimed at boosting cross border trade.\\nBetween them, Ibec and the CBI represent 4,000 companies and around 90 per\\ncent of manufacturing jobs in Ireland. The advent of the single market in\\n1992 is seen by many as the catalyst that led the two organisations to look\\nat ways of overcoming obstacles to trade.\\nThe single market swept away the biggest of the the physical obstacles:\\ndelays at the border for customs and security checks could at one time add\\nup to five hours to the three-hour journey between between Belfast and\\nDublin.\\nThe CBI and Ibec established a joint council in 1991, which drew up a three\\nyear North-South market development programme.\\nThe programme set out to address what the joint council perceived to be the\\nfour biggest obstacles to trade, according to Mr William Poole, the\\nConfederation of British Industry's director of business development for\\nIreland.\\nThe biggest problem, according to Mr Poole, was the lack of available\\ninformation, in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, about opportunities\\non the other side of the border.\\nThe second main obstacle was perceived to be the poor state of road and rail\\nlinks between the two parts of Ireland.\\nThe two other big problems identified by the joint council were the sort\\nthat would be associated with any export market: the risk of adverse\\ncurrency movements and the difficulties of pursuing payment in a different\\njurisdiction.\\nThe problem of lack of information was addressed through the collation and\\ndissemination of as much information as was available, and the organisation\\nof contact meetings for various industry sectors.\\n'The core of activity was to bring together companies from North and South,\\nmatching buyers with sellers and identifying and promoting market\\nopportunities,' explains Mr Poole.\\nIn total, 25 meetings were held, involving 530 companies split more or less\\nevenly between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\\n'The key sectors in which we believed cross border trade could be encouraged\\nwere textiles, food, engineering - including software - and selling to the\\npublic sector,' Mr Poole explained.\\nThe programme has been highly successful and highlighted the potential for\\nincreased cross border trade, Mr Poole maintains. Six Northern Irish food\\ncompanies won orders worth Pounds 386,000, while four engineering companies\\nhave got Pounds lm worth of business.\\nMore than 60 sales leads and Pounds 390,000 worth of business were generated\\nby the software companies which took part in the programme, he adds.\\nThe joint council is now completing a second programme, which will run for\\nfive years and look particularly at the possibility of increasing\\ncross-border trade by small businesses, which are seen as vital creators of\\nnew jobs. Northern Ireland's small business sector represents the province's\\nbest opportunity for job creation and economic expansion.\\n'In marketing terms, it makes sound business sense to look at developing\\nexport business with a trading partner on our doorstep,' explains Mr Bill\\nJeffrey, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland.\\nThe joint council also commissioned management consultants to produce a\\nstudy on the potential for the development of an economic corridor between\\nDublin and Belfast, and this is due for publication shortly.\\nSuch a scheme has been mooted by businessmen for many years, with estimates\\nof the number of jobs it could create ranging from 7,000 to 70,000. The\\nreport is expected to highlight once again problems in the area of\\ninfrastructural links between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\\nThe links, however, are expected to be substantially improved over the next\\nfive years as they are a priority in the Republic's IRPounds 7bn National\\nDevelopment Plan for spending the next tranche of European Union structural\\nfunds.\\nThe report is also expected to show that 'what is really lacking is normal\\nrelationships between companies because of a lack of interaction,' explains\\nMr Geoff MacEnroe, the director of IBEC's North-South Business Development\\nProgramme.\\nThe development of a corridor would give Northern Ireland companies better\\naccess to the island's largest concentration of consumers, in Dublin and its\\nsurrounding towns. Such a corridor might go some way to to help redress\\nNorthern Ireland's trade deficit, which is a relatively recent development.\\nIn 1981, Northern Ireland actually enjoyed a small, Pounds 2m trade surplus\\nwith the Republic.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

The process of transferring government-owned companies and public\\nutilities to the private sector only got going just over three years ago.\\nThe management-employee buy-out of Harland and Wolff, the Belfast\\nshipbuilder and the sale of aircraft and missiles manufacturer Short\\nBrothers to Bombardier, Canadian transportation giant, signalled the start\\nof privatisation in earnest. In spite of fierce trade union opposition, the\\nsales were completed and saved the UK government from paying substantial\\nannual subsidies to keep the businesses afloat.\\nWhile privatised companies have not had it easy since then, Harland has a\\nreasonably healthy order book and Shorts, the region's largest private\\ncompany, was profitable enough two years ago to enable a dividend to be paid\\non shares for the first time in years.\\nSuccessful transfers to the private sector encouraged the government to\\npress on with its timetable.\\nThe first part of the privatisation of the electricity industry was\\ncompleted with the sale of the province's four power stations to British\\nGas, NIGEN (an American/Belgian consortium) and a management-employee\\nbuy-out team.\\nHowever, completing the flotation will not be so easy. Last week Mr Robert\\nAtkins, the province's economy minister, unexpectedly announced that the\\nflotation of the transmission, distribution and supply business of Northern\\nIreland Electricity (NIE) - planned for November - would be postponed. Mr\\nAtkins said a number of outstanding matters needed to be resolved, the most\\nimportant of which related to the funding of a proposed interconnector to\\nScotland. NIE and ScottishPower reached agreement on the Pounds 200m\\ninterconnector project earlier this year, and the government is believed to\\nbe seeking about Pounds 70m from the European Commission towards the cost of\\nconstruction.\\nUnions argue that, as well as leading to large scale redundancies, the sale\\nwill hit consumers in the pocket. The Federation of Unions Supplying\\nElectricity believes the provision of an efficient service will be secondary\\nto the requirement to keep shareholders happy by making profits.\\nThe government dismisses such fears and says legisation will be introduced\\nto protect consumers.\\nWhile the power industry sell-off is almost complete, another project in its\\nearly stages is already causing concern. The privatisation of water and\\nsewerage services in Northern Ireland has set alarm bells ringing, although\\nit is not taking place for another three years. Opponents point to\\nexperience elsewhere in the UK where bills have been rising.\\nTwo months ago, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, revealed\\nthat the government was dispensing with a plan to transfer the Department of\\nthe Environment's water and sewerage functions to a government-owned company\\nbefore privatisation. The new proposal will take the services directly into\\nthe private sector in 1995/96, earlier than would otherwise have been the\\ncase.\\nA customer billing system for water and sewerage will have to be introduced.\\nSince domestic water charges are currently included in rates charges in\\nNorthern Ireland, the changes mean the calculation of the regional rate will\\nhave to be adjusted.\\nThe Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) which represents 1,200\\nemployees in the water industry, is angry at the sell-off proposals.\\nMr Sid McDowell, NIPSA deputy general secretary, said: 'Experience in\\nEngland clearly shows that farming, industry and other commercial interests\\nwill face substantial increases in water charges. Northern Ireland will\\nsuffer those charges over a much shorter timescale than in England.'\\nOne of the big concerns is just who will pay the Pounds 500m being spent in\\nthe province over the next eight years to bring Ulster's water and sewerage\\nfacilities up to EC standards. Mr McDowell has no doubts about where the\\nmoney will come from: 'Years of failing to invest in the water industry\\nmeans that the vast amounts of money needed to make good that negligence\\nwill now be found by privatising and shifting the burden from the taxpayer\\nto the consumer.'\\nThe General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland has called for a system of\\nstrict, independent regulation.\\nSeveral other privatisations are in the pipeline. Northern Ireland Airports,\\nwhich runs Belfast International Airport, is to be transferred to the\\nprivate sector and a study has been commissioned on introducing a private\\nelement into the management and operation of Northern Ireland Railways -\\neither in its entirety or on certain routes.\\nLegislation on compulsory competition tendering is also to be introduced\\naffecting all 26 of Northern Ireland local authorities. Councils will have\\nto put out to tender their main services, such as refuse collecting and\\nstreet cleaning. Again the unions say the cost will be a poorer service and\\njob losses as companies vie for the work by under-cutting each other.\\nIn spite of the oppositon, however, there seems little chance of turning\\nback the tide of privatisation.

Tourism contributes 1.5\\nper cent to GDP in the province, compared with 7 per cent in the republic,\\nso catching up with the south could create 20,000-30,000 tourism jobs in\\nNorthern Ireland. Unemployment is currently 98,000 - 13.1 per cent of the\\nworkforce.\\nStena Sealink, one of the main ferry operators across the Irish Sea, said\\ninterest in Ireland as a holiday destination 'is weighted very much towards\\nthe south because of the troubles in the north. Clearly, a permanent end to\\nthe violence would do no end of good.'\\nThe CBI said a climate of peace would allow manufacturing and service\\ncompanies to focus their marketing on quality production. Mr Nigel Smyth\\nsaid Northern Ireland businesses had one of the best records in Europe for\\nquality awards, but that had been overshadowed by the province's image\\nproblem.\\nThe downside of the peace will be the inevitable cuts in the security forces\\nand security-related industries. Reductions in policing levels and the\\nprison population, and eased security in shops, offices and factories will\\nmean less overtime, job losses, and less money going into the economy - the\\nloss could be as much as Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m per year.\\nThe more pessimistic forecasts envisage job losses in the region of 20,000,\\na figure calculated by Dr Graham Gudgin of the Northern Ireland Economic\\nResearch Council. He said that over four to five years the province's\\neconomy 'will be lucky to break even on jobs'. Mr Smyth of UUJ said the\\nnumber of job losses was more likely to be around 10,000 to 12,000, but he\\nadmitted there could be further indirect losses.\\nMr Michael Smyth said the transition to a peacetime economy would have to be\\nmanaged very carefully. The government would be 'extremely foolish if it\\nwere to send any savings it made through an end to the violence straight\\nback to the Treasury.'\\nThe CBI said any security-related savings and exchequer benefits achieved\\nthrough economic growth 'should be redirected towards wealth creation and\\ntraining'.\\nThe Department of Economic Development in Belfast acknowledged that there\\nwas a danger of short-term job losses. 'But any change will not be a jolt\\nbut gradual, and will be balanced by new jobs over a period. The economic\\ndevelopment budget is very substantial at Pounds 400m and is expected to\\nremain that way.'\\nIt said the Treasury would decide whether additional resources through\\nsavings on security could be redirected towards development.\\nThere may also be help from other sources. Last night Sir Leon Brittan, the\\nEuropean commissioner, said the European Union was ready to consider\\nincreasing the aid and assistance it gives to Northern Ireland.\\nMr Clem Parkes, chief executive of CV Carpets which is based in the\\nnorth-east of the province, said: 'It is always difficult to get managers\\nand specialists that we cannot find here to relocate from Britain. That will\\nbecome much easier. And our experience is that when we do get them here they\\ndon't want to leave.'\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n930909\\n\\n\\nFT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (4): Expertise on call around the\\nworld - Agriculture enjoys a clean and green image second to none\\n\\n\\nTHE face of agriculture, Northern Ireland's largest industry, is changing.\\nGone are the times when a trip to market was little more than an outing to a\\nprovincial town 20 miles away. Today the world is smaller: produce from the\\nprovince's farms and factories is sold in far flung places.\\nAnd greater interest is being taken in what the industry has to offer, not\\nonly in the way of foodstuffs, but also in livestock on the land. For\\nexample, buyers from as far away as Korea have made no fewer than four\\nvisits to Northern Ireland in search of pedigree pig breeding lines. On\\ntheir most recent trip, last month, they picked up 120 high quality boars,\\nbringing the number ofanimals they have bought in the province to a total of\\n500.\\nIt was an outbreak of Blue Ear disease among the mainland pig population in\\nBritain that first focused Korean attention on Northern Ireland pig farms.\\nLike many visitors before them, the Koreans have discovered that Northern\\nIreland has an enviable animal health record.\\nBecause it is part of a small island, Northern Ireland's 'clean and green'\\nimage is second to none. This has been reinforced over the past couple of\\nyears, since the introduction, by the Northern Ireland Livestock Marketing\\nCommission, of a Farm Quality Assured Scheme for beef and lamb. To date the\\nscheme has attracted some 3,251 farmers who between them account for 69 per\\ncent of the annual beef slaughterings in Northern Ireland.\\nBeef from the province is now marketed in Holland under the Greenfields\\nlabel, through the Albert Heijn supermarket chain which dictates that\\nsupplies are from Quality Assured farms.\\nA party of six Northern Ireland representatives of meat companies, on a\\nmission to find niche markets, flew to Brussels two months ago, taking with\\nthem local beef and lamb for a special dinner. As a result of their trip\\nthey have identified significant sales outlets for both products; they\\nintend to increase sales orders to Belgium.\\nWith the prospect of a steep decline in the level of EC Intervention buying,\\nan increase in marketing missions from Northern Ireland is to be expected.\\nThree years ago, some 40 per cent of all slaughterings in Northern Ireland\\nwere sold into Intervention, and the fact that this facility could drop to\\nabout 10 per cent in two to three years is a sobering thought for those who\\nmarket meat.\\nOn a more cheerful note, Northern Ireland farmers have been offered an\\nopportunity to supply two important continental supermarket groups with bull\\nbeef. Mr Brendan McGahan, chief executive of the Livestock Marketing\\nCommission, says: 'The Edah group, which specifies young bulls, is presently\\nbeingsupplied by Dutch and French farmers. It sees supplies from its own\\ncountry becoming scarcer as stocking rates, fertiliser use restrictions and\\nquota considerations begin to reduce stock numbers on their supply farms.'\\nFor years, dairy farmers throughout Great Britain and Northern Ireland have\\nused their own milk marketing boards. Now that is coming to an end.\\nSomething of a 'milk war' has developed in the province between Nestle, the\\ninternational giant, which has a factory at Omagh in Co Tyrone; Strathroy\\nMilk Marketing, which is based nearby; Pritchitt Foods of Newtownards; Dale\\nFarm, which is part of the Northern Foods operation; and Leckpatrick\\nDairies, which is now owned by Cork-based Golden Vale.\\nAll have one thing in common: they want to link up with the province's dairy\\nfarmers - there are more than 6,000 - in direct purchase contracts.\\nAs it dies, the Milk Marketing Board (MMB) is asking producers to help form\\na voluntary co-operative - but the future of Dromona Quality Foods, the\\nMMB's marketing arm, is a bone of contention. The MMB wants to retain it,\\nunder the umbrella of the new co-operative; the Northern Ireland Dairy\\nTrades Federation and several processors want a divorce between the MMB and\\nDromona. The Office of Fair Trading's opinion is that 'the continued\\nretention of Dromona Quality Foods within the new co-operative would be\\nunwelcome in competition'.\\nDairy farmers can speak no ill of Dromona Quality Foods - its profitability\\nbrought them a handout of Pounds 1.8m in July this year. Furthermore,\\nDromona has just announced a 26 per cent increase in its annual profit, to\\nPounds 3.4m, having enjoyed its best-ever trading performance - its turnover\\nincreased by Pounds 10m to Pounds 78m despite the MMB paying 16 per cent\\nmore for milk supplies. Mr Jim Noble, Dromona's managing director, says:\\n'The past year was one of challenge and opportunity in the dairy market both\\nat home and internationally.'\\nExpanded sales to Great Britain and Europe, coupled with aggressive\\nmarketing on the international scene through Halib Foods International, has\\ncontributed to the success. Halib, the wholly-owned, exporting subsidiary of\\nDromona Quality Foods, has just clinched orders worth Pounds 1.6m to supply\\nmilk powder to three important new overseas outlets in, respectively, El\\nSalvador, Bangladesh and a Central African state. It is hoped that this\\ncould develop into long term business worth Pounds 6.5m a year.\\nLooking at Northern Ireland's farms during the past year, the most recent\\ngovernment statistics show gross output rising by 9 per cent to Pounds 935m\\nin 1992, while expenditure rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 513m. Total income\\nfrom farming in the province - a land area about the size of Yorkshire -\\nrose by 24 per cent to Pounds 224m. The Department of Agriculture says that\\nin real terms, after allowing for inflation, this represents a rise of 20\\nper cent to a level well above the 1980s average.\\nProvisional estimates of gross annual capital investment in agriculture\\nindicate little change from the relatively low level of investment in 1991.\\nAt Pounds 103m, total investment was less than 1 per cent above the level of\\nthe previous year. While investment in plant, machinery and vehicles fell by\\n7 per cent to Pounds 45m, investment in buildings and works rose by 7 per\\ncent to Pounds 58m, almost all the increase taking place under the\\nAgricultural Development Operational Programme.\\nThe beef breeding herd increased by 4 per cent, to 264,000 cows, during the\\npast year; but numbers of dairy cows fell by 2 per cent, to 269,000. A\\nslower rate of expansion in the sheep flock continued in 1992, with a 2 per\\ncent increase in both the breeding flock and total sheep numbers. (But at\\n2.6m there are still more sheep than people in Northern Ireland.)\\nCattle account for 33 per cent, sheep for 8.9 per cent of Northern Ireland's\\ntotal receipts. The dairy sector at 26.3 per cent, the poultry and eggs\\nsector at 10.6 per cent and the efforts of pigs producers, with 9.1 per\\ncent, make up much of the remainder. Horticulture, at 4 per cent,\\ncontributes more than crops, which produce only 3.4 per cent of farming\\nreceipts; other small items make up 4.7 per cent.\\nUlster farmers will say that things on the land are just as difficult as\\nthey ever were . . . but they will continue to make a living from it. In the\\nwider context, Northern Ireland expertise in food and farming is widely used\\naround the world, especially in the Middle East, where the Masstock\\nOrganisation has been 'greening the desert' for more than a decade.\\nNow the spotlight falls on Russia. Researchers from the faculty of\\nagriculture and food science at Queen's University, Belfast, are\\nspearheading an EC-funded project aimed at improving the efficiency of the\\nsupply of fresh produce and dairy products in Russia. The Queen's team is\\npart of a consortium which has won funding of Pounds 650,000 under the\\nCommunity's Tacis programme - Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of\\nIndependent States and Georgia - to lead an investigation co-ordinated by\\nNorthern Ireland Public Sector Enterprises Ltd.\\nThe consortium will carry out a study of the milk, fruit and vegetable\\nsectors and establish a food control programme in the Serpukhov district and\\nPushchino municipality, part of the Moscow region, about 100 kilometres\\nsouth of the capital. The project is seeking to help with the privatisation\\nof Russian farms and food distribution organisations.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n931026\\n\\n\\nFT  26 OCT 93 / Northern Ireland industry upbeat after years of gloom:\\nUlster is still the UK's poorest region but, some manufacturers are\\noptimistic about its prospects\\n\\n\\nIT TAKES an almost religious zeal to promote Northern Ireland as a good\\ninvestment opportunity. But even the province's most ardent flag-wavers must\\nhave dropped their heads in their hands on hearing of the bomb that killed\\n10 people in Belfast at the weekend.\\nPersuading people to invest is tough enough and the latest atrocity will not\\nhelp Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board to attract private\\ninvestors, whether indigenous or from overseas.\\nYet persuade them it must, for even though the economy is in better shape\\nnow than it was during most of the last decade, Northern Ireland remains the\\nUK's poorest region. It can ill afford an intensification of sectarian\\nviolence.\\nNorthern Ireland was less affected than any region by the UK recession. In\\nthe worst year of the downturn - 1991 - its output was flat, compared with a\\ndrop of 2.4 per cent for the UK in total. Similarly, employment was barely\\naffected by the nationwide fall.\\nOne helpful factor was the high level of government spending in the region.\\nIn 1991-92, government spending per head, including security costs, was\\nPounds 4,191 in the province, compared with Pounds 2,963 in England, Pounds\\n3,506 in Scotland and Pounds 3,268 in Wales.\\nBut the region was also cushioned by the prudence of its manufacturers and\\nconsumers, who entered the recession with a lower burden of debt than their\\ncounterparts on the mainland and were thus less exposed to the very high\\ninterest rates of 1989-90.\\nAs a result, some of Northern Ireland's industrialists are feeling upbeat\\nabout prospects.\\n'Things have suddenly brightened after years of gloom,' said Mr Norman\\nStewart, company secretary of James Mackie and Son, a west Belfast-based\\nmanufacturer of textiles machinery. With orders from China and Africa\\nswelling the order books, Mr Stewart believes the company may soon expand\\nits 300-strong workforce.\\nThe company's smart new factory overlooks the Springfield Road, which\\nseparates Protestant and Roman Catholic areas. The road is boarded on either\\nside by high barriers to keep the two sides apart and is sometimes referred\\nto as Belfast's Berlin Wall.\\nMr Stewart admits that the company is a 'political animal' and only survived\\nthe 1980s because the government was determined to see the big west Belfast\\nemployer survive.\\nBut in spite of the company's sensitive location Mr Stewart is more\\nconcerned about getting help from the government for overseas contacts and\\nseeing an end to the recession in Europe than he is with the problems of\\nsecurity.\\nAt Desmonds, a textiles factory in Derry that supplies exclusively to Marks\\nand Spencer, Mr Sean O'Dwyer, deputy director, said he believed Northern\\nIreland's troubles could be costing the economy up to 20,000 jobs, but he is\\noptimistic that if places such as Derry - an awkward spot, close to the\\nborder and with a large Catholic community - can shake off its bad image,\\nthen so can the rest of the country.\\n'Derry has done very well over the last two years - it has improved its\\nimage and there is a lot of optimism in the town,' said Mr O'Dwyer.\\nBut in spite of the optimism of individual companies, the Northern Ireland\\nEconomic and Research Centre, an independent research organisation, has\\nestimated that output in Northern Ireland would have to grow at about 10 per\\ncent a year to reduce unemployment to the UK average within a decade.\\nThat is not likely while the violence continues.\\nProductivity was only 83 per cent of the UK average last year, according to\\nthe centre. And although the region's wage levels are low, they are not low\\nenough to outweigh the productivity gap - unit labour costs in manufacturing\\nare 5 per cent to 6 per cent above the UK average.\\nBut political problems can only be part of an explanation of the economy's\\nweakness. Mr Tony Dignan of the centre points out that between 1971 and 1991\\naverage gross domestic product growth per annum in the province actually\\nexceeded the UK average.\\nReferring to Saturday's bombing, he said: 'Over the last 20 years you have\\nhad more than enough incidents of this type, but Northern Ireland has kept\\napace. Political uncertainty is something that investors don't like, whether\\nthey are foreign or indigenous, but people still get up in the morning and\\ngo to work, as they have been doing for the past 20 years.'\\nThe deeper problems include the size of the private sector, which last year\\nemployed 23.9 per cent of male employees in manufacturing compared with a UK\\naverage of 28.6 per cent.\\nBy contrast, males in the public sector in Northern Ireland accounted for\\nalmost one third of the workforce, compared with one fifth in the UK. For\\nwomen the figures are even more startling. Last year, 53.9 per cent of\\nfemale employees worked in public administration in the province compared\\nwith a UK average of 44.6 per cent.\\nMany of Northern Ireland's industrialists complain that the overwhelming\\npresence of the public sector holds back development of the private sector.\\n'The public sector is a very safe haven for a lot of people,' said Mr Nigel\\nSmyth, director of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern\\nIreland. 'It would be nice to see some of them working in the private\\nsector, but somebody at a reasonable level in public administration can live\\nvery pleasantly in Northern Ireland.'\\nManufacturing is concentrated in old-fashioned areas such as textiles and\\naerospace, with limited chances of growth. The small-business sector is also\\nrelatively underdeveloped.\\nAnd, according to the CBI, 35 per cent of Northern Ireland's employees have\\nno qualifications - compared with 29 per cent in Great Britain - while the\\nprovince's population grew twice as fast as the UK average at 0.6 per cent\\nlast year and higher than any other UK region except East Anglia. Such\\ngrowth puts pressure on the economy and government-funded training schemes.\\nYet in the past financial year the province claims to have attracted almost\\n2,000 jobs through inward investment. This was the development board's\\nsecond best performance since it began in 1982.\\n'The most important thing is to get people to come here,' said Mr George\\nForster, executive director of the board's international investment\\ndivision. 'If they only go on the media, then they won't want to know\\nNorthern Ireland.'\\nAt best, Saturday's bombing will prove a temporary discouragement for\\noverseas investors. At worst, it will have stopped the latest peace\\ninitiative in its tracks. This will leave the province still struggling to\\novercome a host of deep-seated structural problems, but without any hope of\\nshedding perhaps the worst image of any region in Europe.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n920921\\n\\n\\nFT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (2): Outward signs of activity\\nmask the real story - Statistics paint a gloomy picture\\n\\n\\nANYONE wanting to place a finger on the economic pulse of Northern Ireland\\nthese days, need do no more than stand on the Queen Elizabeth Bridge over\\nthe Lagan river in Belfast.\\nFrom there an outward appearance of feverish activity meets the eye. The\\nunmistakable heavy-lift cranes of the Harland and Wolf shipyard manoeuvre\\nstructures on to the hull of a bulk carrier - one of six orders the company\\nwon last year; the flash of welding arcs identifies the Lagan weir - the\\ncentrepiece of the Laganside development scheme; the ramps for the\\ncross-harbour road and rail link are taking shape; and in the harbour\\nitself, the sleek lines of the SeaCat ferry from Stranraer can be spotted\\nbringing in carloads of tourists that are feeding a renaissance in the\\nprovince's tourism industry.\\nAccording to a regional trends survey published in July by the Confederation\\nof British Industry, the economic outlook in the province is better than\\nanywhere else in the UK, with order books growing and businessmen showing\\nconfidence by planning new investment. The recession, it would seem, has\\nonly been happening over the water.\\nBut a different picture emerges from the statistics. The Northern Ireland\\nEconomic Council (NIEC), a governmental research and advisory body\\nrepresenting business and trade union interests, notes in a report made in\\nApril of this year that 'almost all the indicators . . . show that the\\nNorthern Ireland economy has been in recession over the past year. Given\\nthat recovery in Northern Ireland has usually lagged behind recovery in the\\nrest of the UK, where GDP and other indicators are still falling, any\\nrespite from these problems may be some way off'.\\n'These indicators add up to what is probably the most gloomy assessment of\\nthe Northern Ireland economy that the Council has produced since the last\\nrecession in the early 1980s,' it says.\\nUnemployment rose in July to 107,100, up 6,700 on the same month last year,\\nand is now at 14.7 per cent of the workforce. Dr Graham Gudgin, the head of\\nthe Northern Ireland Economic Research Centre (NIERC) says his group's\\neconometric model predicts unemployment rising to 16.4 per cent by 1994, to\\nfall later but to remain at 15 per cent until the end of the decade.\\nAccording to the NIEC, over half the unemployed have been out of work over\\none year and are classified as long-term unemployed - almost double the UK\\naverage of 27 per cent.\\nThe recession held off until last year in Northern Ireland, largely because\\nof high public sector employment level and lower house prices resulting in\\nhigher disposable incomes than the rest of the UK. But those watching the\\nlonger term trends are concerned that when there is an upturn, the province\\nwill continue to lag behind the rest of the UK.\\nThe announcement earlier this month from Mr Michael Mates, minister of state\\nfor finance and security in the province, that Northern Ireland will have to\\nface public spending cuts this year with the rest of the UK, has added\\nfurther gloom to the picture.\\nmore radical approaches are needed. 'Until we get off the current growth\\npath, there is no prospect of any convergence with the mainland economy or\\nour Community partners,' he said. Northern Ireland's GNP per capita is\\ncalculated to be around 75 per cent of the rest of the UK, but at the upper\\nend of the poorer regions in the community.\\nThe NIEC calculates that if the EC were to continue its average annual\\ngrowth rate of 3 per cent of the past five years, Northern Ireland would\\nhave to grow at an annual 5.4 per cent to achieve convergence over the next\\n15 years. But figures produced by Dr Gudgin's group show Northern Ireland's\\neconomy has rarely outstripped growth in the overall UK economy, and then\\nonly during recessions.\\nInside and outside government, it is acknowledged that the province's high\\nbirth rate - one of the highest in western Europe - is a big problem.\\nJob creation programmes, industrial promotion and vocational training are\\nall being actively pursued through various governmental agencies, some of\\nthem using EC funding, but Dr Gudgin believes this is not enough.\\n'If we had the same birth rate as the rest of the UK we would have the same\\nunemployment rate. We have to create a highly skilled mobile workforce and\\nincrease the quality of labour, to give people the skills to find jobs.'\\nHe said a vocational training programme 'to bring everybody up to A-level\\nstandard at vocational level' would create a different outlook for the\\nprovince. Although A-level results in Northern Ireland are consistently\\nhigher than on the mainland, he says 'only a third of students go on to\\nA-levels. It is no good educating just half of the people'.\\nThere is little hope of funds being made available for such an ambitious\\nprogramme though. Public expenditure is targeted at Pounds 7bn for 1992/93\\nand will rise by an average 2.4 per cent annually in real terms until 94/95.\\nAs a proportion of total UK public spending, however, it is declining,\\naccording to the NIEC.\\nA growing body of opinion believes that by giving the province autonomous\\npowers and allowing it to work with the Irish Republic to negotiate the\\nallocation of EC structural funds, a higher rate of growth could be\\nachieved. Both parts of the island suffer similar structural problems but\\nfor 1989-93 structural funds allocated to Ireland were almost three times on\\na per capita basis those which were allocated to Northern Ireland.\\nSuch an approach would clearly have to clear the hurdle of a political\\nsolution.

It is\\nestimated that some 1,900 new jobs will result from projects signed up in\\nthe past year, five times the number in 1991.\\nMost notable among the new project announcements are Seagate Technology from\\nCalifornia, which is establishing its first plant outside the US at\\nLondonderry, with a Dollars 65m investment to manufacture wafers for\\ncomputer hard disc drives, and Texmaco, an Indonesian textile firm, which is\\nto invest Pounds 95m in two plants to manufacture new high-tech polyester\\nfibres and fabrics for the European market. Together they will provide some\\n1,400 jobs when operating at full capacity.\\nMr Frank Hewitt, the deputy executive director of the IDB, expressed\\ncharacteristic Belfast caution in assessing the significance of the upturn.\\n'Several of the projects have been under discussion for a while, and are a\\nresult of investment decisions which were probably delayed because of the\\nrecession. We will not necessarily have as good a year this year,' he said.\\nNonetheless, he said, 'Seagate was a tough and hard-fought project, and we\\nare pleased to have won it against the competition'.\\nAttracting companies to invest in Northern Ireland is a particularly\\ndifficult task. 'Not only do we have a perceived peripherality problem with\\nthe sea crossing, which regions, such as Wales and Scotland do not have, but\\nwe also have the security situation and the negative image created by it'\\nsaid Mr Hewitt.\\nHis approach is 'to be totally honest about it all and put it into context.\\nWe cannot attract companies here under false pretences as we want to build a\\nlong-term relationship with them. That requires both sides being honest with\\neach other'.\\nThe peripherality issue was not a big problem for Mr Marimutu Sinivasan, the\\npresident of Texmaco. He said: 'Although we will be supplying the European\\nmarket, we have found that transporting our product from Northern Ireland is\\nabsolutely no barrier to having our operation here, a fact borne out by the\\nother Northern Ireland companies we have talked to who are also selling into\\nEurope'.\\nThe frequency and reliability of ferry sailings to Stranraer from Belfast\\nand Larne, and the lack of traffic congestion in the province are factors\\ncited by many freight forwarders from the Republic preferring to ship out of\\nthe north rather than Dublin 100 miles further south.\\nAVX, a leading manu- facturer of ceramic capacitors used in computers and\\ntelecommunications, set up its European distribution centre at Larne in\\n1991, which the company says was chosen because of the province's advanced\\ntelecommunications network.\\nThis allows orders from across Europe to be placed electronically and to be\\ndelivered within 48 hours.\\nOn the issue of political violence, Mr Hewitt points to the security\\nstatistics which show Northern Ireland to have one of the lowest crime rates\\nin Europe 'even including the terrorist attacks'.\\nIf overcoming these obstacles were not enough, however, the IDB itself has\\nrecently drawn fire from behind its own lines. In a report published by the\\nNorthern Ireland Accounting Office last February, the IDB was criticised for\\nallowing the level of government contributions to overall project costs to\\ncreep up from 21 per cent in 1990/91 to 27 per cent currently. It said that\\ngreater attention needed to be paid to the issue of job displacement from\\nelsewhere in the UK and in the IDB's 'value-added' assessment of IDB-funded\\nprojects.\\nMr Hewitt admits that he faces some conflicting objectives - namely to win\\nthe inward investment for Northern Ireland, but in doing so to keep the cost\\nto the taxpayer at a minimum.\\nDo the criticisms mean that the IDB will be tougher in assessing projects in\\nthe future?\\nMr Hewitt insisted that the IDB already carries out a very rigorous\\nappraisal process but said that in allocating its Pounds 157m budget this\\nyear, 'we are aware we must give value to the taxpayer as well as meet our\\nother objective which is to promote job creation'.\\nAn important job creator over the past four years, has been the boom in\\nback-office services moving to Northern Ireland, attracted by lower wage and\\nproperty costs than in inner-city areas such as London, and top-class\\ntelecommunications.\\nAlthough the driving force for this has lost momentum with the recession, Mr\\nTerence Killen, the IDB section head responsible for promoting such\\nback-office relocations, said: 'Firms should take a longer-term view.\\nProperty and wage cost differentials are likely to widen again as the\\neconomy recovers. Staff turnover is also much lower here and as investment\\nin people rather than machinery or plant is a feature of the services\\nsupport industry, this can be very important'.\\nOne of the biggest such projects announced to date is that by the new Child\\nSupport Agency which is to establish a new centre at Belfast, employing 750\\npeople, and from which it will service all of the east of England.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n941205\\n\\n\\nFT  05 DEC 94 / After the peace, the fight for jobs: Northern Ireland has\\nmuch riding on its investment conference\\n\\n\\nMore than 40 per cent of Northern Ireland's workforce is employed by the\\nBritish government. Many of the jobs in the security sector - up to 20,000 -\\nwill be lost if the IRA and loyalist paramilitary ceasefires prove durable.\\nThe province's unemployed total of 100,000 would jump 20 per cent unless\\njobs are replaced.\\nThat is why so much is riding on the success of the international investment\\nconference which takes place in Belfast on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.\\nMr John Major, the prime minister, is hosting the event and will be backed\\nby US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown. Invitations have gone out to leading\\ninternational companies, organisations which have contributed funds in the\\npast, local political leaders and leading EU trade officials.\\nNorthern Ireland has an urgent need to attract inward investment and it is\\nprepared to pay generous incentives - as the controversial Pounds 61m grant\\nto help the textiles group Hualon set up a plant has highlighted.\\nThe Industrial Development Board, which dispenses grants, has a powerful\\narray of lures to attract foreign companies. A Northern Ireland incentives\\npackage can, in theory, amount to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of\\ntotal costs - though in practice it is usually far less. The IDB claims that\\nin 1993-94 the government contribution to new investment was 21.5 per cent\\nfor both domestic and inward investment.\\nThe IDB says that since 1986 overseas investment has totalled Pounds 1.6bn,\\ninvolving 265 projects and creating 22,702 jobs. The gross cost per job\\nassisted in inward investment promotions in 1993-94 was Pounds 27,424 -\\nmeaning Northern Ireland has one of the most expensive job creation\\nprogrammes in the UK.\\nThe IDB argues that it is necessary to spend money. The image of violence\\nhas been a powerful deterrent to new companies, but the province is also\\nperceived by many outsiders as having a peripheral position in the UK.\\nIt has a population of 1.5m and therefore a small domestic market. Its\\neconomy is poorly integrated with that of the republic and the Irish Sea\\nseparates it from the mainland UK market.\\nIn trying to sell the province to investors, Northern Ireland officials\\nargue that there are other factors apart from grants and incentives which\\nmake it attractive and offset its remoteness.\\nIndustrial land costs Pounds 40,000 an acre compared with Pounds 185,000 in\\nthe English Midlands and upwards of Pounds 400,000 in London. Construction\\ncosts are much lower. According to European Commission figures an index of\\noffice construction costs puts Northern Ireland at 65 compared with 100 for\\nBritain and 113 for Belgium. Residential property is cheaper too. A detached\\nhouse costs Pounds 57,202 in Northern Ireland compared with an average UK\\nprice of Pounds 94,315.\\nThe workforce is educated: Northern Ireland has excellent schools, with a\\nhigher rate of A-level passes than any other part of the UK. Wages are 16\\nper cent lower than in mainland Britain.\\nThe province can offer 50 per cent cash grants for buildings - more generous\\nthan either Wales or Scotland. It can also offer cash grants for machinery\\nand equipment, training and job creation. If a company wants to rent rather\\nthan build a factory there are grants for up to 100 per cent of rental costs\\nfor up to five years. There are also product development grants, marketing\\ngrants, and grants for relief on loans.\\nAlthough the province is handicapped in comparison with the Irish republic\\nby having to levy corporation tax at the UK rate, companies making taxable\\nprofits of less than Pounds 250,000 pay a 25 per cent rate. There are\\nallowances for depreciation on machinery and equipment and for the\\nconstruction costs of industrial buildings.\\nHowever, next week's investment conference is likely to be hampered by the\\nhaste with which it has been organised.\\nAn official at the British consul general's office in the US said: 'When we\\ngot the guest list our first reaction was 'Wow] - we haven't got time.' US\\ncompanies are drawing up boardroom budgets and preparing for Christmas at\\nthis time of year. We think it is too short notice.'\\nA guest list of US corporate 'possibles' was sent to the consul general only\\nin early November by the Industrial Development Board and invitations began\\nto be sent on November 18.\\nWhen the speeches are over, those who have been able to accept the\\ninvitation will be invited to visit factory sites and companies which have\\nalready chosen to set up in Northern Ireland.\\nThey will be bombarded with statistics on why Northern Ireland rather than\\nthe Irish republic, Scotland or Wales is the best place in the British Isles\\nto invest. And their hosts will be hoping they have done enough to overcome\\nthe problems that peace will bring.\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCompetitors for inward investment\\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThere are variations in the level of assistance available.

            "{'text': \"\\n940915\\n\\n\\nFT  15 SEP 94 / Survey of Northern Ireland (7): The textile base remains\\nstrong - Ulster companies are leading suppliers to British retail chains\\n\\n\\nPyjamas and tights may not have the glamour of haute couture, but the\\nmanufacture of these staple items of clothing for British retailers, such as\\nMarks & Spencer, keep more than 16,000 people in work in Northern Ireland.\\nGarment manufacturing is now the most important sector of Northern Ireland's\\ntextile industry, itself the most significant manufacturing sector in\\nemployment terms, with annual sales exceeding Pounds lbn.\\nOut of around 100,000 manufacturing jobs in Northern Ireland, around 26,000\\nare in the textiles industry, of which garment manufacture accounts for\\naround 16,000. An additional 10,000 people are employed indirectly by the\\ntextile industry.\\nThe strength of Northern Ireland's garment industry is due to a combination\\nof factors: the historically strong textile industry base; the growth of the\\nBritish chain stores; and the high level of government support available\\nsince the start of the troubles 25 years ago. The skilled workforce and\\ninfrastructure developed by the linen industry allowed Northern\\nIreland-based garment manufactures to start supplying British retail chains,\\nand to grow with them as they came to dominate the clothing market in\\nBritain.\\n'Chain stores account for 60 per cent of clothing sales in Britain and\\nprovide the volume demand required by manufacturers to achieve economies of\\nscale,' explains Mr Bruce Robinson, the deputy chief executive of Northern\\nIreland's development agency, the Industrial Development Board(IDB).\\nThe generous level of capital grants available in Northern Ireland over the\\nlast two decades - up to 40 per cent more than in the UK - has meant that\\nlocal companies have been able to equip themselves with the expensive\\nmachinery needed to supply products of the quality required by chain stores.\\nNorthern Ireland's garment manufacturers would prefer to explain their\\nsuccess in terms of increased competitiveness.\\n'Our competitive edge is better design, a very close relationship with the\\ncustomer, and a quick response time,' explains Mr Sean O'Dwyer, the managing\\ndirector of Desmonds, a supplier to Marks and Spencer, which employs 2,700\\npeople, making nightwear and other clothing. Northern Ireland-based\\nsuppliers, such as Desmonds, offer British retailers the facility to drop\\nunsuccessful lines in mid-season and increase production of successful ones,\\nso that they avoid being left with surplus stock at the end of the season.\\nAlthough Far Eastern manufacturers might be more competitive on a cost\\nbasis, they are at a severe disadvantage when it comes to response time. The\\nonly way in which they can match Northern Ireland based suppliers is to\\nair-freight their products, which is prohibitively expensive. It is an\\nadvantage which Desmonds has successfully exploited.\\nExpansion plans\\nThe family-owned firm started supplying Marks and Spencer 40 years ago, and\\nnow sells the chain store about Pounds 100m worth of clothing a year -\\n'we're pretty confident that we can increase output. By 1998 we plan to have\\nincreased volume by 40 per cent,' comments Mr O'Dywer. Desmonds plans to\\ninvest about Pounds 5m under the expansion plan creating a further 600 jobs.\\nThe outlook for the garment sector is better now than it was ten years ago,\\nbelieves Mr Terry McCartney, the chief executive of Charnos, which has\\nextensive textiles interest in Northern Ireland through its Adria\\nsubsidiary.\\n'We have seen the industry being weakened by cheap imports, but I think that\\nis changing and we are winning back market share through the quality of our\\nservice and design,' he explains. Adria, which produces branded and\\nown-brand hosiery and lingerie for UK retailers has increased employment by\\n250 this year, opening a Pounds 5.4m lingerie factory in Derry. The company\\nplans to open a new hosiery knitting factory in Strabane this year and hopes\\nto employ over 1,500 people in Northern Ireland by the end of 1996.\\nThe garment industry's strength is not reflected in other parts of the\\nindustry, however - particularly carpet-making. Last month, textile group\\nRichards announced it was closing its carpet-making subsidiary in Bangor,\\nSpence Bryson, with the loss of 175 jobs. The closure was blamed on fierce\\ncompetition in the UK carpet market.\\n'The performance of the carpet industry is linked to activity at retail\\nlevel and the number of new housing starts,' according to Mr Desmond Morgan\\nof the Northern Ireland Textile Association - 'these have been very slow to\\npick up and matters have not been helped by the entry into the UK market of\\nthe US carpet giant, Shaw International.'\\nTextile yarns and fabric are a very important sector of the industry in\\nNorthern Ireland and are set to become more so with the decision of\\nTaiwanese group, Hualon, to set up near Belfast. Although questions have\\nbeen raised about the appropriateness of the decision to give Pounds 61m in\\ngrants to Hualon, the 1,800 jobs which the project will create in Belfast\\nare very welcome.\\nThe fully integrated textile plant will dye, finish, weave and spin nylon,\\ncotton and polyester-cotton fabrics.\\nOther textile companies such as cotton spinners and weavers, Fruit of the\\nLoom and Courtaulds Textiles, form the second largest sector in the textile\\nindustry in employment terms, accounting for the bulk of non-garment\\nemployment.\\nThe linen industry remains a significant employer, although it underwent\\nrationalisation in the mid-1960s and 1970s. Northern Irish linen\\nmanufacturers, who produce about 20 per cent of Europe's linen, have been\\nforced to move away from their traditional market, which was household\\nfabrics. However, the return to fashion of natural fabrics, has given linen\\nspinners a new lease of life in export markets.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Whatever the commercial and strategic attractions\\nof setting up shop in Northern Ireland, the many positive aspects to life in\\nthe province remain overshadowed by deeply-ingrained images of a hopelessly\\ndivided, dangerous society.\\nSir Patrick Mayhew, in a recent speech to businessmen, did his best to place\\nUlster's troubles in their correct perspective, stressing that the province\\nwas 'not running a Clint Eastwood scenario 24 hours a day'. Given recent\\nsuccesses in attracting new corporate investment, the message has not been\\nfalling on deaf ears.\\nNorthern Ireland inevitably has a hard job in selling itself as a business\\nlocation to companies looking to move existing operations or to establish\\nnew ones; why should anyone opt for west Belfast, with its random, sectarian\\nmurders and brick and iron barriers intended to separate alien communities?\\nSurely, life in Telford would be much easier?\\nThe media agenda dictates that Ulster usually means bad news, with the\\nresult that its problems can be distorted and exaggerated. But problems\\nthere are and they cannot, sensibly, be minimised by those seeking to\\nattract new investment from within the UK or beyond.\\nBusiness assets in the province are regularly the victims of paramilitary\\nactivity and employees are regularly subjected to intimidation; security\\ncosts can be punitive and employers face a daunting catalogue of obligations\\nunder a tough set of fair employment laws designed to eradicate\\ndiscrimination in the workplace.\\nBut for most people and most sections of the business community, Ulster's\\ntragedy rarely intrudes directly into their daily lives. The province's\\neconomy has, despite the recession, remained relatively buoyant and\\nperformed better than in the UK as a whole. Last year, for example,\\nmanufacturing output grew by double the UK average.\\nEqually to the point, the province can provide a business base which offers\\nnewcomers, by virtue of its extraordinary difficulties, extensive financial\\nincentives to help overcome reservations about moving into what many see as\\nnothing less than a 'war zone'.\\nUlster, because of its higher-than-average UK unemployment and its 'category\\none' status within the EU aid hierarchy, can offer cash help that is\\nunrivalled anywhere in Europe. No matter that one development official\\nremarks: 'The bigger the dowry, the uglier the bride'.\\nCash help may not, alone, be sufficient to give Ulster the edge over\\nalternative locations but in the final analysis, it can tip the balance.\\nFinancial aid played a big role, for example, in the recent decision of\\nTranstec, a Birmingham-based specialist engineering group, to set up a\\nPounds 16m plant in Londonderry to manufacture aluminium castings for the\\nautomotive sector.\\nThe company will join a growing list of automotive suppliers who have now\\nestablished operations in the province, including companies from Japan,\\nFrance, the US and Germany. The new plant will, in the first instance,\\nsupply cylinder heads for shipment to Ford of Germany.\\nTranstec already employs more than 2,000 people in 12 wholly-owned\\nsubsidiary operations, most of them in the West Midlands. According to Mr\\nPeter Munday, chairman of the company's automotive division, the business\\nhad decided on strategic grounds to look beyond its existing casting\\nfacility in England for the new plant and had considered a number of\\nEuropean locations before opting for Ulster.\\nThe reasons for deciding on Londonderry, already the recipient of a\\nsignificant inward flow of overseas investment, include good infrastructure,\\nthe potential for recruiting quality labour and the all-important assistance\\nof the local industrial development board.\\nMr Munday added: 'The package of assistance also had to be sufficient to\\ncounter offers being made to us by other European locations. Aluminium\\ncasting is a very competitive, price-conscious business and we needed to\\nensure we kept our costs as low as possible.\\n'We could only do this by examining development areas with the highest\\nincentives for inward investors. Although this was the major priority, it\\nneeded also to be coupled with the other plus factors which can be delivered\\nin Northern Ireland, such as good transportation links and a factory which\\ncould be built quickly to our specifications.'\\nThe Industrial Development Board is not always too keen to discuss the\\ndetails of financial assistance for specific projects but Mr John McGuckian,\\nits chairman, disclosed that the total government aid package made available\\nto Transtec will be about Pounds 4m. Few locations in Europe will prove as\\ngenerous in offering cash help accounting for one-quarter of total start-up\\ncosts.\\nOperational costs, once established, are also significantly lower than in\\nBritain or in mainland Europe, a point forcefully underlined by Sir Patrick\\nMayhew in a recent ministerial check-list of Ulster plus-points. He claimed,\\nhowever, the beneficial picture was 'not the result of sweated labour but in\\npart from a generally lower overall cost of living in Northern Ireland'.\\nFor overseas investors, access to the markets of the European Union offers\\nanother important bonus and has been the driving factor behind location\\ndecisions taken by companies from the US and south-east Asian countries. IDB\\nestimates suggest that around 55,000 people in Ulster are now employed by\\nforeign owners.\\nThe total is rising steadily in the wake of a particularly successful period\\nof IDB activity and is shortly expected to be given a huge boost with the\\ndecision by Hualon, a Taiwanese textile group, to commence the biggest\\ninward investment project since the ill-fated De Lorean car plant.\\nThe European Commission has given clearance to a synthetic fibre project\\nwhich will bring 2,000 jobs to Glengormley, close to the Belfast. At one\\nstage, the project was thrown into doubt when European textile companies\\ncomplained that it would create unfair competition, but the overriding need\\nfor jobs in the province finally won the day.\\nThe new plant is expected to cost nearly Pounds 157m and the UK government,\\nvia the IDB, will put around Pounds 60m into the kitty. With financial\\nsupport on such a scale, fears about the likely impact on business of\\nlimited, civil strife quickly recede.\\nThe Hualon decision was welcomed by Mr Roy Baillie, vice-chairman of the\\nConfederation of British Industry in Ulster, not just for the badly-needed\\njobs it would bring but also for the strong signal it would send to other\\ninternational companies looking for a route into Europe.\\nThe hope is that such decisions will not be seen merely as a positive move\\nin the face of Ulster's problems but that, in bringing new prosperity to be\\nshared by all parts of the community, they will help end the province's\\ntroubles.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n941215\\n\\n\\nFT  15 DEC 94 / Belfast Investment Conference: Five large investments in\\nUlster confirmed\\n\\n\\nMr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday announced new investment in\\nNorthern Ireland amounting to Pounds 74m at the international investment\\nforum he hosted in Belfast.\\nAlthough some of these investments have been in the pipeline for some time,\\ntheir announcement - timed to coincide with the conference - served to\\nunderline the forum's success.\\nThe organiser, the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland, said\\nit was well pleased with the event. More than 300 delegates attended,\\nincluding a large delegation from the US accompanying Mr Ron Brown, the\\ncountry's secretary for commerce, who addressed the conference.\\nThe investments confirmed yesterday were:\\nDu Pont of the US is spending Pounds 13.5m on developing prototype\\ntechnologies at its Lycra facility in Londonderry, bringing its investment\\nin research there to Pounds 38m in the past three years. Du Pont employs\\n1,000 production staff in Londonderry.\\nFord, the US motor group, which has had a presence in Belfast for 30 years,\\nis to invest Pounds 15m in the production of new engine components.\\nNacco Materials Handling of the US will be investing Pounds 11m at\\nCraigavon, consolidating the plant's position as a source for its new range\\nof Hyster and Yale forklift trucks. More than 100 extra jobs will be created\\nby 1996.\\nBritish Telecommunications is to invest Pounds 30m in a new office block at\\nLaganside in Belfast and a further Pounds 1.5m in expanding its customer\\nservices centre at Enniskillen, providing 113 new jobs. Sir Iain Vallance,\\nBT chairman, said the investment would be in addition to the Pounds 30m BT\\nexpects to invest in Northern Ireland in the coming year.\\nFujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, which is already established in\\nCounty Antrim, is to build a Pounds 3.5m factory at Springvale Business Park\\nin west Belfast which could create 100 new jobs.\\nA shadow hanging over the conference in the shape of a possible boycott by\\nSinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, evaporated when Sinn Fein\\ncouncillors arrived at the Europa Hotel early yesterday morning and began to\\nlobby delegates over the province's economic future. They subsequently took\\nseats in the conference hall and listened to some of the speeches before\\nwalking out.\\nOne potential US investor, however, criticised the treatment of Sinn Fein.\\nMr Alan Hevesi, the New York City comptroller - who controls a Dollars 50bn\\n(Pounds 30.4bn) pension fund - said that Mr Gerry Adams, the president of\\nSinn Fein, should have been invited to the conference.\\nHe said that exclusion of 'a representation of a substantial portion of the\\npopulation' from the conference was 'a mistake on the part of the British\\ngovernment'.\\nAfter the conference Mr Major visited the site of the new BT office block in\\nLaganside.\\nHe later went with his wife Norma to the centre of Portadown, which was\\ndevastated 19 months ago by an IRA bomb.\\nThe Majors were given a warm welcome as they walked through the central\\nshopping district.

STRIFE CAPTURES MINORITY INTEREST \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlacks and members of other minority groups paid more attention to articles \\nabout racial tensions in New York City than any other news story in the last \\nmonth, and most believe that the press has done a mediocre job at best of \\ncovering the issue, according to a monthly survey by the Times Mirror Co. \\n\\n\\nAmong nonwhites, 38% said that they were \"very closely\" following accounts of \\nthe New York trial of two young white men convicted of charges related to the \\nkilling of a black teen-ager in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and of the \\nboycott of Korean-owned stores in Brooklyn by some blacks. Only 13% of whites \\nsaid that they were giving those stories \"very close\" attention. \\n\\n\\nThe racial disparity in how much attention those stories received was a \\ndeparture from the usual pattern that has been found by the Times Mirror News \\nInterest Index. The monthly survey about which news stories people follow \\ngenerally has found that interest in news breaks down along lines of income and \\nage, but not of race. \\n\\n\\nThose who were paying close attention to coverage of the tensions in New York \\nindicated unhappiness with the press. Only 7% said that they thought the \\ncoverage was excellent -- usually about one-quarter of respondents give an \\nexcellent rating to news coverage they are interested in -- and 58% said that \\nthe coverage was only \"fair\" or \"poor.\" \\n\\n\\nIn New York itself, press coverage of racial tensions has been highly \\ncontroversial. Both blacks and whites attending the Bensonhurst trial shouted \\nepithets at reporters and photographers, and some photographers were injured in \\nmelees after the verdicts were announced last month. \\n\\n\\nOverall, in a month when no single news story captured an overwhelming amount \\nof public interest, the Bush-Gorbachev summit was the story cited by more \\npeople than any other as the one they were paying attention to, with 38% of \\nthose polled saying that they were following it \"very closely.\" That was about \\nthe same percentage as said they were \"very closely\" following news coverage of \\nthe presidential election in 1988 or the Navy\\'s escort of oil tankers in the \\nPersian Gulf in 1987. \\n\\n\\nAs is usually the case, older people and those with more education -- core \\nreaders for most major newspapers -- were more likely to say that they were \\npaying close attention to the summit than others. \\n\\n\\nAmong people under 30 who were polled, more said that they were paying very \\nclose attention to reports of floods in the Southwest (29%) than the summit \\n(26%). \\n\\n\\nHowever, asked what the \"most important\" news story of the last month had been, \\nroughly 50% of those who had an opinion named the summit, whether or not they \\nwere paying attention to it. The remaining respondents split, with no more than \\na handful specifying any other story. \\n\\n\\nTimes Mirror Co., which conducts the survey every month, owns several \\nnewspapers and magazines, including The Times. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nSeptember 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOUNTERPUNCH: HOW DO THE MEDIA HANDLE BEING \\'USED\\'? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWould you buy this? \\n\\n\\nWhen a Ted Koppel, Dan Rather or equivalent, engineers an interview with an \\nofficial of a nation with whom we are in conflict, say Iraq, start it this way, \\nfull screen: \\n\\n\\n Warning: According to the U.S. Censor General, the following interview \\ncontains material that may be injurious to a proper American attitude. \\n\\n\\n If you would not go that far, perhaps you wonder whether the media, TV in \\nparticular, are being used to suit the purposes of the other side. \\n\\n\\nThe short answer is: Of course. Everyone uses the media. Or tries to. Iraq, get \\nin line. \\n\\n\\nThe \"using\" takes dozens of forms, up to and including outright purchase, \\nincluding the cultivation of favored reporters, the granting of interviews, the \\nleaking of information, true and false. Make your own list. All good reporters \\nknow that if they are finding their jobs easy to do and information a cinch to \\nget they must be being used. \\n\\n\\nIn the case of Iraq, the avenues for favorable media use have been almost as \\nrestricted as its sea lanes. Its normal channels, none too effective into the \\nWestern world at best, are pretty well cut off. After sitting for a while on a \\npile of requests from Western journalists of all stripes, apparently it was \\nconsidered advantageous to \"use\" a limited number of American TV reporters, \\nthus trading a little access, strictly controlled, for potential propaganda and \\npolitical rewards. \\n\\n\\nNot surprisingly, the invitee jumped at the chance to get to the heart of the \\nstory after reporting so long from the periphery. TV network news divisions are \\nin a perpetual scramble to be first, whether to penetrate the old Iron or the \\nnew Iraqi Curtain. \\n\\n\\nWhether by choice or accident, the early inside-Iraq field was left to ABC and \\nCBS News, with Koppel first off the mark, but Rather shortly on scene and \\nremaining nearly a week, not alone, but with a hefty team, nine people in all. \\nOut of this came Koppel\\'s initial news-making interview and a scattering of \\nsolid information from Rather and staff, including the first word of foreigners \\nbeing scattered for possible use as human shields, and climaxed by his hourlong \\ninterview with the Iraqi dictator, run in prime time. \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, coverage of a closed society is tricky. Wartime conditions \\nheighten the difficulty, and certainly the danger. Sometimes being \"used\" may \\nsimply be the only way to go. When that happens, it is essential that the \\nviewer be made fully aware of what is, or what may be, going on. If there were \\npreconditions to an interview they must be made public. The presence of \\ncensorship or monitoring should be disclosed. \\n\\n\\nThe guiding principle is: Trust viewers. Level with them. Let them know what is \\ngoing on behind the scenes. The people who watch the news are just as smart as \\nthe people who cover the news. Maybe smarter. In this crisis, as far as I have \\nbeen aware, the networks have been careful to spell out the circumstances of \\ntheir access in general terms, but in less detail than I would have felt both \\nappropriate and interesting. \\n\\n\\nA curious new dimension seems gradually to have been added to the ill-defined \\nbusiness of \"using\" the media. A handful of network stars enjoy prestige of \\nsuch a nature that their presence and comment at the scene of a story can \\naffect national attitudes. \\n\\n\\nHeads of government know anchors, or at least their names. PR men in every \\nembassy in the United States know enough about American TV to tell the home \\noffice: \"If you want to reach Americans, have our man talk to. . . .\" Fill in \\nyour favorite anchor. \\n\\n\\nAnchors themselves, always on the lookout for a competitive edge, must of \\ncourse be aware that they are the prime target for being used. \\n\\n\\nUsed or not, television, and TV\\'s top news people seem destined to continue to \\nplay a widening role on the stage of world events. Perhaps that age started on \\nNov. 14, 1977, when Walter Cronkite talked alternately to Egypt\\'s Anwar Sadat \\nand Israel\\'s Menachem Begin, out of which came their historic meeting. Anchor \\ndiplomacy. \\n\\n\\nWill Barbara Walters get George Bush to sit down with Saddam Hussein? \\n\\n\\nAnd who will be using whom? \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nSeptember 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCOUNTERPUNCH: THE PRINT PRESS PAYS TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO TRAPPINGS OF TV NEWS \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the hotly competitive world of network news, the Persian Gulf crisis is a \\nmajor mobilization of anchors, reporters, producers, camera crews and public \\nrelations hype. It\\'s a kind of two-front war. One involves the actual coverage. \\nThe other involves selling that coverage to our brothers and sisters who cover \\ntelevision as a beat in the nation\\'s newspapers. \\n\\n\\nAt all the networks, the aim is to be first with the best. But, for many who \\nwrite about us, what counts is not what is being said but who gets where and on \\nthe air first. \\n\\n\\nAs someone who has played the PR game with enthusiasm over the years, I am a \\nlittle amused and frustrated by the turn this particular battle has taken. Most \\nof the newspaper coverage of our collective efforts has concentrated on who \\ngets where first. Or gets on the air first, even if it\\'s a matter of minutes. \\n\\n\\nNow, the networks aren\\'t blameless in this. It\\'s a vicious cycle that we are \\npart of. We lean on our press and publicity people to get the word out on how \\ngreat we are doing or, failing that, how poorly the others are faring. \\n\\n\\nWhat happens when the television columns become a time-keeper\\'s score card? ABC \\ngets Sam Donaldson into Saudi Arabia in the middle of the night and then rolls \\nhim out of bed to appear on \"Nightline\" so it can claim the first report out of \\nthat country, even though Sam privately complained he\\'d been on the ground only \\ntwo hours and had nothing original to say. \\n\\n\\nDan Rather deserves the credit and coverage given him for getting the first \\nAmerican one-on-one interview with Saddam Hussein. But many television \\ncolumnists, judging far-off events from home, didn\\'t bother to analyze the \\nself-serving answers of the Iraqi leader or question the use of American \\ntelevision to make his case. Instead, they told us that Dan didn\\'t have time to \\nshave before the interview and that during small talk with Saddam Hussein the \\nCBS anchor discussed his favorite pastime, fly fishing. This, after earlier \\ncolumns deploring the evolution of anchors as television personalities first \\nand journalists second. \\n\\n\\nIn writing about broadcast journalism\\'s coverage of the Persian Gulf crisis, \\nform almost always takes precedence over substance. Almost no credit went to \\nNBC\\'s Fred Francis for breaking the story of CIA training of Kuwaiti resistance \\nfighters in Saudi Arabia to strike inside occupied Kuwait; David Martin of CBS \\nwas not interviewed about his scoop on President Bush\\'s decision to send troops \\ninto Saudi Arabia; no one cared whether ABC\\'s Forrest Sawyer had shaved when he \\nreported that Westerners in Iraq were being rounded up. \\n\\n\\nMy friend Bryant Gumbel spent a week doing memorable live reports from inside \\nSaudi Arabia for \"Today.\" His work received only fleeting attention on the TV \\npages until \"Today\\'s\" ratings shot up. This from the columnists who accuse us \\nof an obsession with ratings over substance or anything else. \\n\\n\\nThis kind of time-keeper, travelogue, ratings-driven coverage in the television \\npages is not unique to the Persian Gulf crisis. It goes on during political \\ncampaigns, space shuttle explosions, uprisings in Beijing, the collapse of the \\nBerlin Wall. Too much attention on the trappings of television news and not \\nenough attention on the day-to-day and long-term coverage. In fact, I always \\nfind it more than a little shocking when television writers will confess they \\nreally didn\\'t have time to actually watch the programs. They were writing from \\nnetwork press releases or spin or hearsay. \\n\\n\\nThat only feeds what is ultimately a form of journalistic cancer: We get so \\ncaught up in our own press we lose sight of our real role. Newspapers are not \\ninnocent players. They approach broadcast journalism with a cynical double \\nstandard. They decry its flamboyance while simultaneously encouraging it. After \\nall, writing about anchors and ratings is easier than actually watching and \\nlistening to the programs these people work so hard to put on. \\n\\n\\nSo, the next time the printsters write about who is doing the best job of \\nreporting on TV, look for the what, where and why along with the who and when. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWORLD IS WATCHING BUSH-HUSSEIN SHOWDOWN; \\n\\n\\nCOMMUNICATIONS: INSTANT GLOBAL COVERAGE BRINGS EVERY FEINT AND MOVE OF THE GULF \\nCRISIS INTO THE HOME. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the advertisement, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is face to face with George \\nBush. \"The World Is Watching,\" reads the text. On the last line are the \\ninitials \"CNN.\" \\n\\n\\nIt is meant to suggest that the world is watching Turner Broadcasting\\'s Cable \\nNews Network, but the advertisement for the 24-hour news channel has a another, \\nperhaps unintended and more powerful, meaning. \\n\\n\\nThe confrontation with Iraq is the largest deployment of American military \\nforces since the Vietnam War and the first full-scale U.S. troop commitment in \\nthe age of instant global communications. Today, to a degree far surpassing \\nanything in Vietnam, the world truly is watching -- minute by minute, via \\nsatellite, in real time. \\n\\n\\nThe signs of the importance of that are everywhere. On Tuesday, for instance, \\nABC anchorman Ted Koppel gained entry to Iraq, and an exclusive Foreign \\nMinistry briefing, after the Jordanian royal family summoned him to dine in \\nAmman and later agreed to pass a message for him. \\n\\n\\nThe results of Koppel\\'s briefing were broadcast within hours to America, \\ncarrying with them the hint that Iraq might be seeking a diplomatic solution. \\nIn the argot of electoral politics, international conflict had become spin \\ncontrol, with Baghdad fully engaged in the game. \\n\\n\\nAnd in this war, the anchorman is not merely a messenger. He is a kind of \\nneutral emissary, and the network a virtual nation-state with diplomatic \\nstatus. \\n\\n\\nAll this raises several important questions about the news media\\'s role in the \\nMideast confrontation: \\n\\n\\nIn the most intense crisis of his presidency, how has President Bush managed \\nthe public message and the media that convey it? \\n\\n\\nHow are the media, such an important influence since Vietnam, performing in the \\ncurrent crisis? \\n\\n\\nIs it even possible that a long-term, full-scale military operation is no \\nlonger sustainable in the echo chamber of instant, constant global video? \\n\\n\\nExperts who have been involved in White House and Pentagon communications say \\nthat the President, at least initially, handled the news media with marked \\nskill. \\n\\n\\nIf anything, they suggest, television and the press initially showed a lack of \\nskepticism about the Administration\\'s actions and went out of their way to \\ndepict Saddam Hussein as bloodthirsty and perhaps even unstable. \\n\\n\\nWithin a week, however, they note that the media echo chamber -- operating at \\nhyper-speed -- seemed to have run full cycle. Some of the most influential in \\nthe media were casting a cold eye on American policy, a quick reminder of the \\ndifficult task the Administration would have maintaining public support for a \\nlong engagement. And, critics say, the President, since then, may have made \\nsome public relations missteps. \\n\\n\\nStill, most experts argue that the success of any involvement in the Middle \\nEast will not rise and fall with the media. \\n\\n\\nEven those who believe that the press shaped the outcome in Vietnam argue that \\nthe negative images of that war -- of a jungle ground war, of U.S. high \\ntechnology against civilian militia, of uncertain purpose -- will not be \\nrepeated in the desert sand. \\n\\n\\n\"We are not going to be seeing the brutal, ugly kind of man-to-man combat, or \\nnapalm war, which was so offensive to have in our living rooms,\" predicted \\nMichael K. Deaver, the image-maker behind former President Ronald Reagan. \\n\\n\\nOthers argue that it is political reality, not news media interpretation, that \\ndetermines political outcome. \"Even if you had (only) the Pony Express and \\ntelegraph, the Vietnam War was not going to work,\" said David Halberstam, who \\nwon the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of that war for the New York Times. \\n\"There was an essential lack of political legitimacy of the American position \\nthere, and eventually the media were going to reflect that.\" \\n\\n\\nFrom the beginning of the Iraqi crisis, White House officials say, the \\nPresident and his aides decided to offer the public extraordinary access, \\nincluding almost daily press briefings. That created, in effect, a continuing \\nconversation with the public. \"We\\'ve gone overboard to be accessible,\" one \\nhigh-ranking White House official said. \\n\\n\\nDeaver says \"the policy itself lent itself to a lot of information.\" With the \\nAdministration engaged in intense diplomatic negotiations, \"they were very busy \\ndoing things which seemed to create news\" -- and that generated \"a feeling that \\nit was under control.\" \\n\\n\\nOne area the Administration may have been less than candid about, however, was \\nthe number of troops being deployed. Initially, it indicated that about 4,000 \\ntroops, perhaps two battalions, might be headed for Saudi Arabia. \\n\\n\\nBut even the first night of the Iraqi invasion, Aug. 2, intelligence officials \\nknew and told at least one reporter that 85,000 to 90,000 troops probably would \\ngo. Apparently they offered a lower figure publicly to avoid provoking a \\nreaction in Iraq or shocking the American public. \\n\\n\\nWhile Administration officials say now it would be unwise militarily to be too \\nprecise with troop figures, former White House communications director David \\nGergen also cautions against continuing to be disingenuous about numbers. \\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t want to get into that as a steady diet if you have to increase your \\nnumbers there. . . ,\" he said. \"That dredges up too many memories\" of \\nuntrustworthy troop and casualty figures in Vietnam. \\n\\n\\nAnother wrinkle of the initial Bush media strategy was that, aside from \\npresidential news conferences, the Administration did little to try to overtly \\ncontrol the \"spin\" or interpretation of events in the first few days, \\nparticularly in the way it depicted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. For more than \\na week, for instance, Administration officials refused all invitations to \\nappear on network TV news programs. \\n\\n\\nIt hardly mattered. Critics charge that, in place of a reticent Administration, \\nthe press by itself did much to characterize events the way the Administration \\nwould have wanted. Time magazine even did a psychological profile that included \\nan Israeli intelligence handwriting analysis concluding that Hussein \"suffered \\nfrom severe megalomania with symptoms of paranoia.\" \\n\\n\\nMarvin Kalb, the longtime NBC and CBS chief diplomatic correspondent who \\nteaches press and public policy courses at Harvard University, believes the \\npress showed \"an inadequate degree of skepticism\" during that critical first \\nweek. \\n\\n\\n\"I make no case for Saddam Hussein, but we have dealt in the past with very \\nunpleasant types,\" Kalb explained. Whipping up anti-Iraq sentiment, he \\nsuggested, \"is not the measure of what is in the best interests of this \\ncountry.\" \\n\\n\\nHussein himself, he noted, \"was a crucial ally for 10 years.\" \\n\\n\\nBowdoin College professor David Kertzer warned that characterizing events too \\nsimplistically might leave the American public unable to understand such \\nfactors as Hussein\\'s support in other Arab countries. \\n\\n\\nCoverage of the Arab perspective became more sophisticated in time, monitoring \\nof daily press coverage suggests, as more reporters actually reached the Middle \\nEast. The change was particularly marked on the networks, which tended to have \\nfewer reporters in place at first. \\n\\n\\nBut with cycles moving so quickly, by the weekend the President was facing \\ncriticism from the highest quarters of the press for policies that in midweek \\nhad been widely praised. Instant public opinion polls in the Washington Post \\nand New York Times detected a fragile, perhaps short-lived public support. \\n\\n\\nThe New York Times on Page 1 went so far as to virtually dismiss American \\npolicy in the gulf: \"Laid bare,\" it said, \"troops have been sent to retain \\ncontrol of oil in the hands of a pro-American Saudi Arabia so (oil) prices will \\nremain low.\" Then, quoting an editorial cartoon, it concluded that \"they are \\nthere to defend the security . . . the value . . . the principle we hold dear \\n-- 18 miles per gallon.\" \\n\\n\\nWashington Post editorial page editor Meg Greenfield wrote that she could \\n\"already hear the distinct drip . . . drip . . . drip . . .\" of public support \\nleaking away. \\n\\n\\nAnd this week, the networks have focused not so much on Hussein\\'s bloody past \\nas on such matters as the less lofty purpose behind American involvement. \"Had \\nSaudi Arabia not had oil,\" CBS quoted one expert as saying Wednesday, \"it would \\nhave been thrown . . . to the dogs.\" \\n\\n\\nIt was as if in an age when the media are increasingly interpretive, a \\njournalistic \"scoop\" had been replaced by the rush to write the next level of \\nanalysis, every cycle gaining centrifugal velocity. It is the same movie we \\nhave seen before, this time played at triple speed. \\n\\n\\nThe answers from the best experts on the murky art of media control offer \\ndivergent if not completely contradictory advice on how Bush should buttress \\nthe Administration politically and hold together the fragile domestic and \\ninternational coalition. \\n\\n\\nGergen suggested that the President should deliver a prime-time speech soon \\n\"that explains in the very clearest possible terms what his purpose and goals \\nare\" to stem \"increasing pressure on the right wing to raise the stakes . . . \\nand increasing pressure from the left, particularly overseas, to compromise for \\na lesser outcome.\" The President\\'s brief, early-morning address of last week -- \\nunseen by most Americans -- was insufficient, Gergen believes. \\n\\n\\nOthers, such as former Reagan Administration communications director Thomas \\nGriscom, said being too specific about actual policy goals would set up the \\nPresident for criticism. \"Once you start putting particular benchmarks out \\nthere, then you have to achieve them,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nPresident Jimmy Carter\\'s press secretary, Jody Powell, said the real danger is \\nfor the President to become too concerned with these short-term pressures by \\nthe press, which demand a new plot change every day, and a new chapter every \\nweek. \\n\\n\\n\"In a general sense, the temptation to do something because it will look good \\nin the short term ought to be resisted,\" Powell advised. \\n\\n\\nIndulging that temptation, some believe, may already have hurt the \\nAdministration. On Tuesday, the President returned to Washington from vacation \\nto deliver an uncharacteristically blistering partisan attack on the Democrats \\nover the budget. At least some in the media, such as National Public Radio\\'s \\nCokie Roberts, said it was an attempt to shift the focus of attention somewhat \\naway from Iraq. \\n\\n\\nIf so, the maneuver apparently did not work. The story that night and next \\nmorning remained focused on Iraq, and the President was criticized even within \\nhis own party for his political charges. The following day, Bush switched gears \\nand delivered his most blistering attack yet on Hussein. \\n\\n\\nOver time, if handled properly, the Iraq story will become a constant of life \\nand fade from the top of Page 1, former Reagan communications director Griscom \\nargued. \\n\\n\\nWhen that occurs, Halberstam agreed, that will make the Bush Administration\\'s \\njob easier. \"At the height of interest, the President\\'s hands are more tied,\" \\nhe said. \"As it goes down from media overkill, the President has more play.\" \\n\\n\\nThat is one reason why those involved in the news media on both sides believe \\nthat sustaining a military involvement over a long period of time is still \\npossible. \\n\\n\\nFred Hoffman, who did four tours in Vietnam for the Associated Press, covered \\nthe military for 25 years and finally became the Pentagon press spokesman for \\nReagan, said the differences between the Iraq confrontation and Vietnam are \\ndrastic. For one, the importance of American interests is clearer this time. \\nFor another, he said, the Vietnam War dragged on for four years before public \\nsupport started to flag, in about 1965. \\n\\n\\nDeaver argued that the degree of international support of the American \\nsituation this time is another significant difference, as is the fact that \\nHussein invaded Iraq, invoking memories of Hitler\\'s blitzkriegs. \\n\\n\\nTrue, the experts said, with more media constantly echoing themselves, there is \\nnow a sensation of hyper-dramatization and hyper-impact greater than during the \\nwar in Vietnam. Movie director Oliver Stone told the American Psychological \\nAssn. last week that, \"is hysteria.\" \\n\\n\\nYet those who know that \"hysteria\" best concur with Powell, the spokesman for \\nthe Carter Administration that was itself done in partly by a crisis in the \\nMiddle East: \"The substance, in the end, is what matters most.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nDecember 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGULF CRISIS FOUND TO BE 1990\\'S TOP STORY \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crisis in the Persian Gulf was by far the biggest news story of 1990, with \\nmore than 60% of Americans participating in monthly surveys saying they have \\n\"closely followed\" developments since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August. \\n\\n\\nAccording to a year-end assessment issued Friday, the only domestic development \\nthat drew similarly close attention was a direct spin-off of the gulf crisis: \\nthe rise in gasoline prices caused by the invasion\\'s impact on world petroleum \\nmarkets. \\n\\n\\nEach month, the Times Mirror Center for The People & The Press surveys a \\nsample of Americans to determine what news stories attracted the most attention \\nand what the public learned from them. \\n\\n\\nIn its year-end report, the center said the gulf crisis had generated unusually \\nintense and prolonged interest among news consumers. \\n\\n\\nWith one exception, the only news stories that attracted more than 40% interest \\nin this year\\'s monthly surveys were those involving the U.S. military buildup \\nin the gulf, the hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait and the steep rise in \\ngasoline prices at home. \\n\\n\\nThe single exception was the U.S. invasion of Panama, which was closely \\nfollowed by 60% of those who participated in last January\\'s survey. \\n\\n\\nBy contrast, the peaceful revolution in Eastern Europe and turmoil within the \\nSoviet Union attracted relatively little attention. In no month were stories on \\nthese topics closely followed by 30% of those surveyed. \\n\\n\\nThe intense focus on the gulf conflict appeared to divert attention from news \\ncloser to home. Besides the gasoline price rise, the top-rated domestic stories \\nwere the decline of the economy and sensational crimes. \\n\\n\\nNews interest intensified as the U.S. economy began to slip in late summer, \\naccording to the surveys. By November, 39% of respondents said they were \\nclosely following economic news. \\n\\n\\nOnly sensational crime stories tended to attract as much attention. The \\nSeptember murders of five people near the University of Florida campus \\nregistered 36% on the \"closely followed\" index, and 29% of survey participants \\nsaid they focused on the bizarre Boston suicide and murder of Charles Stuart \\nand his wife. \\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, there was a clear consensus on the most over-covered story of the \\nyear: the marital troubles of Donald and Ivana Trump. In March, a record 55% of \\nthose surveyed said they were fed up with news about the Trumps\\' travails. \\n\\n\\nThe center also tallies how many respondents can correctly identify names in \\nthe news. The results suggest that even the key figures in the most closely \\nfollowed stories are not well known. Only 17% could correctly identify Gen. \\nColin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation\\'s top \\nmilitary leader. However, 37% were able to correctly identify Marla Maples, \\nDonald Trump\\'s paramour. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

It deals overwhelmingly with print media. Only 10 of its 540 pages deal \\nwith broadcast media. \\n\\n\\nNor is Repap a guide to all the print media. It deals only with American print \\nmedia. The Canadian press is covered in eight pages. The British Press per se \\nis not covered at all, although the Financial Times and The Economist are \\nincluded. \\n\\n\\nNor is it a guide to all the American print media. Newspapers are covered much \\nmore heavily than magazines, and the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal \\nand the Washington Post more heavily than other newspapers. On Repap\\'s list of \\n90 \"Highest Rated Journalists of 1989,\" 45 come from those three newspapers. \\n\\n\\nNor is it a guide even to all that those three newspapers do. The limitation \\nconcealed by its title is revealed by its subtitle: \"A Critical Review of the \\nMedia\\'s Recent Coverage of the World Political Economy.\" \\n\\n\\nHave you won a Pulitzer Prize for drama criticism? Don\\'t expect to find your \\nname in Repap. The arts have no place here. Neither does cultural coverage in \\nthe broader sense. And neither, to name a more surprising omission in a guide \\nwith money and power on its mind, does science. The guide has something of the \\nsame labeling problem as one of Jude Wanniski\\'s books does. Titled \"The Way the \\nWorld Works,\" that book turns out to be a primer in supply-side economics. \\n\\n\\nFor one-third of its length, Repap is an \"Overview of the Print Media\" with \\nseparate entries on individual newspapers and magazines. As a brief statement \\nof the state of each publication, the guide is clear, concise and informative. \\nAny working journalist who had received a job offer from one of the listed \\npublications could read the relevant entry and show up for an interview \\nbasically in the know. \\n\\n\\nFor two-thirds of its length, however, Repap descends to personalities with a \\nvengeance. It offers free-wheeling, tendentious capsule evaluations of the work \\nof individual reporters and editors in the areas it cares most about; namely, \\n\"Commentators, Financial Reporters and Columnists, National Security/Diplomatic \\nCorrespondents and Social/Political Reporters.\" Like restaurants, journalists \\nin these categories are awarded one, two, three or four stars. \\n\\n\\nThe markedly conservative slant of the editors means that reporters critical of \\nthe Bush Administration tend to be taxed as tendentious or -- a favorite tag -- \\n\"fashionable.\" Writing of Joseph Lelyveld, whom it names as the likely next \\neditor of the New York Times, Repap opines: \"Lelyveld\\'s journalistic weakness, \\nwe suspect, is a personal commitment to \\'human rights,\\' as he understands the \\nterm, in a way that may engage him emotionally.\" Distressing indeed. \\n\\n\\nReporters supportive of the Administration, by contrast, tend to be praised as \\nobjective and independent. Conservative journalists are, in general, watched a \\nbit more closely than liberal ones are. Last year, observing that Michael Novak \\nhadn\\'t written much lately, Repap ventured to hope that he might pick up the \\npace a bit in the coming year. \\n\\n\\nThe most outspoken liberal journalists, however, never go unnoticed. Alexander \\nCockburn of The Nation receives three stars and an entry in which he is coyly \\npraised for \"the street fighter\\'s tendency to go for the most vulnerable spot \\nof an opponent other than the jugular.\" Hit \\'em high, hit \\'em low, hit \\'em \\nwhere. . . . \\n\\n\\nNot all entries are animated by the editors\\' conservative bias, but, in a way, \\nmost of the best entries are. The way to lose the Repap editors may not be to \\nhold liberal views but, whatever your journalistic ability, to forgo \\nimmediately identifiable political plumage. Politics arouses Repap as nothing \\nelse. \\n\\n\\nIt was Mike Wallace, if I recall correctly, who remarked after years of \\ninterviewing that interesting people talk about three things: politics, sex and \\nreligion. Repap, omitting the latter two, is energetic but narrow in the way \\nthat people who care only about money and power often are. Still, no one in or \\nnear the print media will fail to find something of interest in this volume, \\nand people who find Capitol Hill and Wall Street the only really interesting \\nparts of the country may find it the last media guide they\\'ll ever need. \\n\\n\\nI do not suggest any increase in Repap\\'s coverage of culture and the arts, \\nsince I doubt that the Polyconomics/Repap team could really do the job even if \\nit tried. I do suggest, however, that even on its own terms, the guide could do \\na better job with science and technology. \\n\\n\\nIt claims that the major stories of 1989 were \"Communism\\'s Crackup and \\nCrackdown,\" \"Drugs and Crime\" and \"Planet of the Year,\" meaning \\nenvironmentalism and, in particular, the Greenhouse Effect, on which, \"taken as \\na whole, the news media did its worst work this year.\" But if a science story \\ncan be judged one of the three stories of the year, why do science journalists \\nnot rate a category of their own in Repap? \\n\\n\\nThe world political economy of Repap\\'s subtitle will change profoundly if the \\nenvironment, the carrier of life, becomes the bringer of death. Next year, will \\nRepap mock Earth Day as the non-story of the year, and will it again ignore \\nscience journalists as a group? One fears it will, but given the fact that this \\nguide has, for the moment, no serious competition, one can only hope it won\\'t. \\n\\n\\nNext: Jonathan Kirsch reviews \"Lawyers and Thieves\" by Roy Grutman and Bill \\nThomas. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\nLanguage:  English \\nArticle Type:BFN \\n\\n  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 3, INA -- A senior Ministry of \\nInformation and Culture aide has exposed means used by the \\nUnited States and its allies, through their media, to prepare \\nthe atmosphere for war against Iraq well before January 17, 1991. \\n  In a lecture he gave on the role of the Iraqi media during \\nthe war in the Gulf at the Iraqi Society for Libraries and \\nInformation here on Monday [31 January], Information \\nUndersecretary Naji al-Hadithi said the Western media resorted \\nto all means of distortion, depicting Iraq as an aggressive \\nstate. \\n  The media, he said, claimed that Iraq was preparing to \\nattack \\nSaudi Arabia while Iraq had no intention whatsoever to launch \\nsuch aggression. They also used the fabricated story of \\nincubators in Kuwait which later proved to be a public relations \\nploy by the American Hill and Norton company. \\n  Mr al-Hadithi said that the Western media also played an \\nimportant role in foiling the diplomatic attempts to resolve the \\nsituation. Western media had communicated to the whole world \\nthat Iraq was against diplomatic attempts to solve the problem, \\nwhile on the contrary Iraq wanted to sit down with Kuwaiti and \\nSaudi officials to resolve the issue. \\n  Mr al-Hadithi said the Western media had distorted the \\nminutes of a meeting between President Saddam Husayn and the \\nU.S. charge d\\'affaires in Baghdad. They said President Husayn \\nhad told the U.S. envoy that Saudi Arabia \"is not far away and \\nthe use of force is our only means\", al-Hadithi said, adding \\nthat such a statement is not in the minutes at all. \\n  the undersecretary said the Iraqi media with its limited \\npotentialities had to face huge media facilities of the West \\nwhich were all directed against Iraq. He said three of the 33 \\nnations which launched the war against Iraq in 1991 possess the \\nlargest media establishments in the world. The U.S.A. possesses \\na large news agency, the Associated Press, Voice of America \\nradio which dispatches its programmes in all languages, Mr \\nal-Hadithi said, adding that the U.S. also possesses the largest \\ntelevision networks in the world such as CNN, NBC, ABC and CBS. \\n  Britain also possesses big media means such as the BBC and \\nREUTERS news agency while dispatch their news to hundreds of \\nmillion of people in the world. France also has large media \\nestablishments, he added. \\n  The undersecretary said the war against Iraq started with \\nthe \\nidea in the West that Iraq was only a military camp full of \\nnuclear and other weapons. Iraq\\'s media means directed abroad \\nhad to change this Western image against Iraq, al-Hadithi said. \\n  \"Therefore, we allowed, as from September 20, 1990, few \\nmonths before the war, hundreds of American, other Western and \\nArab journalists to come to Iraq and write about the real \\nsituation here\". They visited historical sites, agricultural \\nprojects and eventually wrote about the normal life in Iraq. \\n  Mr al-Hadithi said there was no way for planners of Iraq\\'s \\nmedia but to open the door wide for foreign journalists to come \\nto the country before and during the war. \\n  \"While the U.S. and the allies had prevented journalists \\nfrom \\nvisiting front lines in Saudi Arabia and enforced a heavy \\ncensorship on what they wrote or pictured, Iraq allowed \\njournalists to go wherever there were U.S. and allied raids in \\nvarious Iraqi provinces\". \\n  He said the U.S. Administration had tried to prevent Western \\njournalists from staying in Baghdad in order not to report on \\nthe casualties among Iraqi civilians and the destruction of \\ncivilian facilities. He added that they invented a lie, namely \\nthat al- Rashid hotel, where foreign journalists used to stay \\nduring the war, was a bunker for Iraqi Army commanders and they \\nthreatened to attack it. All these propaganda means were used \\nto force journalists to leave, al-Hadithi concluded. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

Final \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBUSH TRAILING REAGAN IN FIRST-YEAR TV COVERAGE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Bush has gotten significantly less television coverage than his \\npredecessor during his first year in office and that coverage is increasingly \\nnegative, according to a media-monitoring group. \\n\\n\\nRobert Lichter of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan \\nresearch group that monitors television news coverage, said an analysis of the \\nBush coverage, from his inauguration through Dec. 1, indicates that Bush has \\nreceived about a third as much television exposure as Ronald Reagan did in the \\nsame period of his presidency. The amount of coverage is declining almost \\nweekly and getting significantly more negative, according to Lichter. \\n\\n\\nNonetheless, Bush retains high public approval ratings. The latest Washington \\nPost poll, taken Nov. 30-Dec. 4, found the President\\'s job-approval rate was \\n62%. While that is considered strong, it is 10 points lower than his rating a \\nmonth earlier. \\n\\n\\nLichter said the lack of correlation between positive media coverage and high \\npoll ratings is strong evidence that the public\\'s perception of how a President \\nis doing relates only in part to his media image. \"A President\\'s image is not \\njust a result of his media portrayal. It results from a general level of \\nsatisfaction with the public,\" he said. If the economy is generally strong and \\n\"communism is crumbling across the world,\" Lichter speculated, the public feels \\nsatisfied with presidential performance even if the news media are criticizing \\nit. \\n\\n\\nAccording to Lichter\\'s assessment of about 1,800 reports on Bush and his \\nAdministration, the President has been the subject of 574 stories, contrasted \\nto 1,782 for Reagan in the same period. Unlike Reagan\\'s team, which consciously \\naimed at a daily television message, Bush\\'s media aides appear to make no such \\neffort. \\n\\n\\nLichter found Bush generally had better report cards on TV for foreign policy \\nand defense expertise than for domestic issues and that by far the heaviest \\ncoverage he has received has been in the foreign policy area, particularly \\nrelations with the Soviets. \\n\\n\\nThe study also confirmed that the Bush family dog, Millie, has been a media \\ngodsend. Millie, the study found, has been mentioned in more television stories \\nthan three Cabinet secretaries, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, \\nAgriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward \\nJ. Derwinski. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCUTBACKS, LACK OF ACCESS HURT IRAQ TV COVERAGE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe crisis in the Middle East is a conflict that refuses to cooperate with \\ntelevision. \\n\\n\\nIn a world that more often than not makes way for TV cameras, the networks -- \\nwith hundreds of correspondents, producers, photographers and staff members \\nmassing on the fringes of the conflict -- can\\'t get into Iraq, Kuwait or Saudi \\nArabia. \\n\\n\\n\"You can\\'t cover the story if you\\'re not there,\" said David Miller, director of \\nforeign news coverage at NBC. \"It\\'s like covering a forest fire and not being \\nat the forest fire.\" \\n\\n\\nUnable to gain access even to U.S. warships, forced in some instances to report \\nby telephone from secret locations in Persian Gulf emirates, television news \\nfrom the Middle East has weighed in heavily on the side of words and lightly in \\nterms of pictures. \\n\\n\\nForeign correspondents -- many brought in from the field because of budget \\ncutbacks -- were rousted out of new assignments in Burbank and New York and \\nsent to makeshift Mideast bureaus. One nation on the fringes of the conflict, \\nthe tiny emirate of Dubai, has allowed reporters in, but only on the condition \\nthat the correspondents not name the country in their reports. Instead, they \\nmust say that they are reporting \"from the Persian Gulf.\" \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s an area of the world where (we) don\\'t have a great deal of resources, and \\npeople have to be moved from great distances,\" said Robert Murphy, vice \\npresident for news coverage at ABC. \"And the fact that access to Saudi Arabia \\nand Iraq and Kuwait is impossible makes covering the story very, very \\ndifficult. You\\'ve got to almost set up listening posts.\" \\n\\n\\nIn fact, many of the local bureaus are little more than listening posts. \\nNetwork crews monitor Iraqi and Saudi television and send taped copies of that \\nfootage home to New York. Reporters -- including CBS lead anchor Dan Rather -- \\nfrantically work the phones and prepare reports that won\\'t be accompanied by \\nlive pictures. \\n\\n\\nBit even the verbal reports have been difficult to obtain: At least once this \\nweek there was no room on the primary communications satellite that links the \\nMiddle East and the United States. To get their reports home, CBS, NBC and ABC \\nhad to beam them the long way around the world, across the Indian Ocean, at a \\ncost twice that of a normal transmission. \\n\\n\\nFor pictures, crews take off in helicopters and photograph ship movements in \\nthe Gulf, said Miller. The only event to which reporters will have full access \\nis the Arab League summit in Cairo. \\n\\n\\n\"We sent a crew to the Suez Canal and got pictures of the U.S.S. Eisenhower \\ngoing through,\" Miller said. \"And a crew got pictures of F-111s taking off from \\nTurkey -- and there aren\\'t supposed to be F-111s in Turkey.\" \\n\\n\\nThe verbal nature of the story has prompted different strategies for deploying \\nnetwork anchors. Rather is the only network anchor currently on the scene, with \\nNBC and ABC saying that their anchors are better off in New York, where they \\ncan conduct on-air interviews with correspondents and world figures. ABC did \\nsay Thursday that it was sending \"Nightline\" host Ted Koppel to Egypt for the \\nsummit, however, where he will serve as a \"sub-anchor\" to Peter Jennings on \\n\"Nightly News\" on top of his \"Nightline\" duties. \\n\\n\\nCBS\\' Rather -- who sources at the network say is tentatively scheduled to go to \\nCairo today -- spent the first days of the crisis in Jordan, reporting by \\ntelephone while the network ran a still photograph of him along with a map of \\nthe Persian Gulf. \\n\\n\\nProducers and news executives say the lack of pictures has affected coverage, \\nskewing it more toward the analytical and away from dependence on the day\\'s hot \\nphotos. \\n\\n\\n\"We\\'re doing now what we were supposed to be doing all along, and that\\'s \\nreporting -- and not just creating pretty packages,\" said Lane Venardos, \\ndirector and executive producer of special events for CBS News. \"We miss having \\nthe pictures because we are a visual medium, but we\\'re also journalists. All \\ntoo often in this business the journalism gets buried under the pictures.\" \\n\\n\\nSo far, NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN have beefed up existing bureaus in Israel and \\nEgypt, and established makeshift bureaus in Amman, Jordan; Dubai, the United \\nArab Emirates; Ankara, Turkey; and Damascus, Syria. \\n\\n\\nIronically, reporters are working out of hotel rooms in some cities where the \\nnetworks once had fully functional bureaus. Cutbacks over the past several \\nyears have led NBC to close its bureaus in Jordan and the Persian Gulf and to \\ncut its Cairo operation to a small office with no correspondent. CBS maintains \\na bureau in Israel, but only a small office in Cairo and no other regular \\nbureaus in the Middle East. And the scaling back has not been limited to the \\nregion. CBS recently closed its bureaus in Paris and Athens. \\n\\n\\n\"We closed them because there was nothing going on,\" said NBC\\'s Miller. \"We \\njust can\\'t keep bureaus open to look nice. We just haven\\'t got the money any \\nmore to keep bureaus functioning when they\\'re not in the news.\" \\n\\n\\nThe result has been a thinly stretched news corps covering a story with serious \\nimplications for not only international affairs, but -- with the impending loss \\nof oil shipments from Iraq and Kuwait -- for the world economy as well. \\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s no pinch from having cut back,\" said ABC\\'s Murphy. \"But there\\'s no \\nquestion that if another major story in the world breaks, were going to have a \\nhard time covering it.\" \\n\\n\\nOnly the Cable News Network, the 24-hour news service owned by Atlanta \\nbusinessman Ted Turner, has been expanding instead of contracting its reach. \\n\\n\\n\"You don\\'t send green hands into a story like this that could potentially be \\nquite dangerous,\" said Ed Turner, CNN executive vice president for news \\ngathering. \"It\\'s not an easy story to report.\" \\n\\n\\nStephen Hess, a news analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., \\nsaid that by cutting back their bureaus around the world, the networks risk \\nhaving no experts in an area in crisis. \\n\\n\\nCoverage of the current imbroglio in the Middle East, Hess said, is a case in \\npoint. \\n\\n\\n\"This is real parachute journalism,\" Hess said. \"There is not one person who \\nhas dropped in there who has great knowledge of the Middle East, who speaks \\nArabic or has a Ph.D. in Arab studies.\" \\n\\n\\nAlso fueling the cutbacks, Hess said, are technological improvements that allow \\ncorrespondents and crews to move so quickly in and out of different parts of \\nthe world that they can be based in New York or London and still cover breaking \\nnews in faraway places. \\n\\n\\nVenardos, at CBS, conceded that there might be reporters sent to a trouble spot \\nwho have never been there before, but said that was the nature of news \\ngathering. \"Ultimately, people will be over there who will be first-timers, and \\nthen they\\'ll be second-timers the next time they\\'re over there,\" Venardos said. \\n\"That\\'s how you get experience.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

NEARLY \\nHALF KEPT TRACK OF THE PLIGHT OF U.S. HOSTAGES IN IRAQ. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the fourth month in a row, Americans paid extraordinary attention to news \\nof the Persian Gulf crisis -- even though the issue was largely ignored by \\ncandidates in this month's elections -- according to a survey released today. \\n\\n\\nAnd although Democrats hope that their call for economic fairness will bring \\nthem closer to the White House, the survey shows that most Americans are \\nunaware even of the results of the budget debate. \\n\\n\\nThese are two of the findings in the November Times Mirror News Interest Index, \\na monthly survey that measures public response to the news. The surveys are \\nconducted by the Times Mirror Center for People & the Press, an operation \\nof Times Mirror, which owns the Los Angeles Times and other media enterprises. \\n\\n\\nA total of 62% of Americans paid close attention to news about the Persian \\nGulf. No other story has held such intense public interest over so prolonged a \\nperiod in the two years that Times Mirror has conducted these monthly surveys. \\nThe plight of American hostages in Iraq was closely followed by 49%. \\n\\n\\nAmericans also began paying more attention to news of the economy, as much as \\nafter the October, 1987, stock market crash. In both instances, 40% followed \\nthe stories. \\n\\n\\nAnd 34% of respondents said that they had paid very close attention to the \\nbudget negotiations in Congress, although most were left confused. Only 46% \\nknew that Congress adjourned having reached a budget agreement, while 30% \\nthought it had not, and 24% had no idea. \\n\\n\\nSome evidence suggests that respondents did not recognize many differences \\nbetween the final budget deal and the one negotiated earlier by the White House \\nand congressional leaders. For instance, even among those who were aware of the \\nbudget agreement, public support was virtually identical to the earlier plan -- \\n35% in favor, 47% opposed. \\n\\n\\nWhile analysts believe that the recent elections reflected widespread \\ndiscontent with Washington, Americans had little grasp of the lawmaking that \\nCongress and the White House had actually done. \\n\\n\\nOnly one new law penetrated public consciousness -- the banning of smoking on \\nall domestic flights was recognized by 64%. \\n\\n\\nAnd some evidence suggests that President Bush might feel little political \\nfallout from legislation he had vetoed. For instance, 27% thought that Bush had \\nsigned a civil rights bill into law. Only 29% knew that he had not. Likewise, \\n19% thought that he had signed into law the family leave bill, while 23% knew \\nthat he had not. \\n\\n\\nThis ignorance of legislation was just as evident among those most affected. \\nOnly 29% of non-whites knew that the civil rights bill was vetoed, for \\ninstance. And only 20% of women under age 40 knew that the family leave bill \\nwas vetoed. \\n\\n\\nMore generally, 32% of Americans said they paid very close attention to \\ncriticisms of President Bush for changing his mind on taxes and for being \\nseemingly inconsistent in his statements about the Persian Gulf. Democrats paid \\ncloser attention to these stories (38%) than Republicans (28%). \\n\\n\\nThe survey, which interviewed 1,208 adults Nov. 8-11, has a margin of error of \\nplus or minus three percentage points. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Polls show \\nblack mayors think papers do a lousy job of covering the black community, and \\nmany black media professionals agree. \\n\\n\\nSo what has happened since the days of the Civil Rights struggle, when the \\nmedia and the black community were \"de facto allies against Jim Crow?\" In the \\nJuly/August The American Enterprise, National Public Radio reporter and UC \\nBerkeley journalism professor William J. Drummond presents a number of \\ninteresting explanations for the \"complete about-face of prevailing sentiment\" \\ntoward the media. \\n\\n\\nBlack politicians, he writes, \"no longer enjoy the shield of moral leadership \\nonce accorded them by the civil rights movement. They must take their lumps \\nfrom the press like other politicians, and they find this an unwelcome \\nsurprise.\" \\n\\n\\nAt the same time, though, Drummond suggests, there is a tendency for the media \\nto ignore black politicians on issues other than those directly related to \\ntheir race. All of which is complicated by the fact that minority journalists \\nassert their rights as professionals to cover any issue they choose. As a \\nresult, the reporters who presumably have the greatest insight into and empathy \\nfor the black community don\\'t want to be pigeonholed into covering it -- not \\nthat the number of black journalists is even remotely representative of the \\npopulation. \\n\\n\\nSo, where does that leave us? \\n\\n\\nAbout where we were after the race riots of the mid-to-late \\'60s, when \\nPresident Johnson\\'s Kerner Commission warned that the media \"have not \\ncommunicated to whites a feeling for the difficulties and frustrations of being \\na Negro in the United States.\" \\n\\n\\nIf Drummond\\'s excellent analysis has a weakness, it\\'s in his inability to \\nreconcile two conflicting matters. On the one hand, he cites the growing demand \\nthat the white-dominated media stop focusing so intently on the misleading \\nstereotypes of \"black pathology\": drug addiction, crime and the like. On the \\nother hand, he and others complain about the unwillingness of the media to shed \\nlight on the problems faced by black America. Hence the frustrating \\nobservation: \"There is black pathology, but it is given more attention than \\nwhite pathology, and it is less understood.\" \\n\\n\\nPart of the problem may simply be, as he writes, that \"some of the black anger \\nat the media must be anger at the news itself. The news for black America is \\nnot good.\" \\n\\n\\nThe underlying criticism in his piece, never explicitly stated, seems to be \\nthat the media do a lousy job of covering almost any historically and \\nculturally complex issue or community, regardless of race, creed or color. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREQUIRED READING \\n\\n\\n* Japan may be the world\\'s leading joho shakai (\"information society\"), and its \\njohoshi (\"information magazines\") are one way the Japanese get their \\nminute-by-minute information fix. The August Egg examines Trendy, Box, Quark, \\nPumpkin, Lettuce Club, McSister, and others that fill Japanese newsstands, \\noffering \"an extended, open-ended set of instructions for life.\" More than a \\nlook at magazines, this is an excellent study of where Japanese and American \\nculture coincides and collides. \\n\\n\\n* First there was the \"Mommy Track.\" Then the \"Daddy Track.\" Now, the July 16 \\nNewsweek tells us there\\'s the \"Daughter Track.\" Readers who can overcome their \\nnatural aversion to overly catchy news weekly trend labels will find an \\nimportant examination of women\\'s demanding role as double caretakers, first of \\ntheir kids and then of their ill and aging parents. \\n\\n\\n* Next year, construction begins on the Westside for a bicycle freeway. If the \\nfolks at Bicycle Magazine had their way, the city would turn that two-mile \\nstretch over to automobiles and reserve the rest of L.A.\\'s hundreds of miles of \\nfreeway for bicycles. The August issue offers dozens of suggestions on how to \\nmake bicycle commuting more appealing until that freeway shift happens. The \\npiece is aptly titled: \"How the Bike Can Save L.A.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNEW ON NEWSSTANDS \\n\\n\\n* In the old days, Rolling Stone was the cream of the rock rag crop and Creem \\nwas a sort of low-fat imitator. Now Creem is back as a large format bimonthly, \\nlooking a lot hipper than today\\'s Stone -- which means it devotes itself to the \\nsurviving stars of the late \\'70s and early \\'80s rather than those of the \\'60s \\nand Hollywood celebrities. (Judging from the first issue, it completely skips \\nthe socially redeeming stuff Stone still does so well.) \\n\\n\\nWith big pictures and -- for the most part -- mere snatches of prose, the \\nmagazine seems to be catering to the shortened attention-span syndrome.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nMarch 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S., ISRAEL: IS THE PARTY ABOUT OVER? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThree years ago I asked a colleague who worked in network television why the \\nAmerican media was so fascinated with Israel. Even then, the Israeli Cabinet \\nwas on the brink of collapse. Television news, along with major and minor \\nnewspapers, were saturated with stories and commentary about the unfolding \\nevents. \"Israel is always a good story for us,\" my friend explained, \"because \\nyou are a democracy, our strategic ally, sharing our values and have a dynamic \\npolitical system.\" \\n\\n\\nToday, another Israeli Cabinet has disintegrated and Prime Minister Yitzhak \\nShamir has lost a vote of confidence in Israel\\'s Parliament, plunging the \\ncountry into a search for a new government. The crisis, set off by a Bush \\nAdministration plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, marks a historic \\nwatershed: Will Israel embark on the road to peace or will the countdown for a \\nnew war begin? \\n\\n\\nUnlike the past, these events are not dominating U.S. air waves or receiving \\nmuch more than perfunctory coverage in America\\'s newspapers. This shift \\nreflects a waning American interest in Israel, in particular, and in the Middle \\nEast, in general. The Tyndall Report, which monitors the amount of time network \\nnews devotes to stories, ranked the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 10th in 1989. \\nThe previous year it was in the top five. \\n\\n\\nEven militarily significant defections fail to attract much media attention in \\nthe United States. Five months ago, the three major networks each devoted \\nroughly 15 seconds of their nightly newscasts to the defection of a Syrian air \\nforce pilot and his MIG-23 fighter to Israel. When an Iraqi pilot landed his \\nMIG-21 in Israel in August, 1966, the American media\\'s appetite seemed \\ninsatiable. This shift in treatment cannot be explained by differences in the \\nmilitary-intelligence value of the defections, since there were none. \\n\\n\\nAlthough signs of Americans\\' fading interest in Israeli affairs could be \\ndetected in the early 1970s, the turning point came in December, 1987, when the \\nPalestinian uprising began. Israel was unrelentingly depicted in the U.S. media \\nas an uninspired, oppressive force with a government that adamantly refused to \\ntalk peace with the Palestinians. Many Americans were shocked by the Israeli \\nsecurity forces\\' treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. \\nIsraeli disregard for Palestinian human rights undermines the values that are \\nthe moral basis of Americans\\' attraction to Israel, the only democracy in the \\nMiddle East. \\n\\n\\nTalking to American friends and officials of the Reagan Administration in late \\n1988, I detected a deep sense of disappointment in Israel\\'s unwillingness to \\nreciprocate for the newly moderate declarations of the Palestine Liberation \\nOrganization. I also sensed a growing American fatigue with the indecisiveness \\nof Israeli domestic politics. Those impressions linger to this day. \\n\\n\\nThe sensational events unfolding in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, South \\nAfrica and Nicaragua rightly captivate the world\\'s and America\\'s attention. But \\nsudden reconciliations in some countries also reinforce the frustration many \\nAmericans feel toward Israeli reactions to various Middle East peace proposals. \\nIsrael is seen by the U.S. media and increasingly by its most loyal American \\nfriend -- Congress -- as sinking deeper and deeper into its own political heart \\nof darkness, most of its leaders as unmovable objects. \\n\\n\\nEven the attitude of American Jewry, always a constant source of sympathy and \\nstaunch support for Israel, has undergone a major change. A recent public \\nsurvey of Jewish leaders in the United States not only showed a sharp decrease \\nin support but also a readiness (80%) to criticize Israel in public. \\n\\n\\nYet most Israelis are unaware of these shifting attitudes. They think and \\nbehave as if Ronald Reagan were still in the White House. The former President \\nwent farther than any predecessor to make Israelis feel secure. His \\nAdministration never fully protested Israel\\'s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. \\nAlthough his State Department railed against the construction of Jewish \\nsettlements in the occupied territories, it took no diplomatic action. The \\nWhite House enthusiastically blessed a joint American-Israeli memorandum on \\nstrategic cooperation. And in the 1980s, Israel received close to $40 billion \\nin economic and military aid from the United States. That kind of generosity \\nand kid-glove treatment understandably leads Israelis to believe they can do no \\nwrong in American eyes. \\n\\n\\nAbundant writing is on the wall, however. President Bush and his secretary of \\nstate, James A. Baker III, lack their predecessors\\' emotional and ideological \\ncommitment to Israel, the heart of the alliance. Their language and deeds \\ndepart from past practice. \\n\\n\\nOver Israeli protests, the Bush Administration is continuing a dialogue with \\nthe \\n\\n\\nPLO. In a recent visit to Los Angeles, the President said that no new Jewish \\nsettlements should be built in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem. His \\ninclusion of East Jerusalem was unprecedented, raising serious doubts about \\nIsrael\\'s claims to sovereignty there. Earlier, Baker suggested that building \\nnew Jewish settlements or expanding old ones in the occupied territories must \\nstop before the United States would consider guaranteeing an additional $400 \\nmillion in loans to pay for housing newly arrived Soviet Jews. \\n\\n\\nIn Congress, the movement away from Israel is no less discernible. The proposal \\nby Minority Leader Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) -- to cut foreign aid for five \\ncountries, including Israel, by 5% -- is a case in point. I have little doubt \\nthat Dole\\'s suggestion was coordinated with Baker and Bush. The senator\\'s words \\nwere carefully chosen to remind Israel to get more serious about peace \\nnegotiations with the Palestinians. Additionally, they were an indication of \\nAdministration impatience with Israeli leaders. \\n\\n\\nIf my fellow Israelis do not soon recognize the gravity of this situation -- \\nthat unquestioning American support can no longer be assumed -- they will wake \\nup one day in horror to discover what I have already detected: The party may be \\nover for Israel in the United States. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n\\nBFN \\n\\n [Report on population growth issued by the South African \\nInstitute of Race Relations on the SAPA PR Wire Service] \\n  [Text] The population in South Africa is not growing as \\nfast as it was, 57 percent is urbanised, and the country's \\neducation levels are improving slowly. Cape Town, in the \\nmeantime, has become one of the fastest growing cities in africa. \\n  These trends emerge from statistics supplied by the latest \\n[South African Institute of] Race Relations survey. The survey, \\nrecording the results of the most recent census, shows that \\nbetween 1986 and 1991 the population of South Africa (excluding \\nthe `independent' homelands) grew at an average rate of 1.9 \\npercent. A year, compared with 2.3 percent. Between 1980 and \\n1985. \\n  Nevertheless, by the year 2018 the country's population will \\nbe close to 80m [million], the maximum number of people South \\nAfrica's water and other resources can support. \\n  In 1993 the total population (including the ten homelands) \\nwas 40.3m, according to an Urban Foundation estimate quoted in \\nthe survey. \\n  Key projections, recorded in the survey, indicate that by \\n2010, 69 percent (33.2m) of the total African population will \\nlive in urban areas and 31 percent (15.2m) in rural areas. This \\nmeans that some 22m additional people will have to be provided \\nfor in urban areas by 2010. \\n  By 2000 the population of Natal will comprise 23 percent of \\nthe total South African population, of which 54 percent will be \\nliving in the Durban area. With an average growth rate for its \\nAfrican population of more than 13 percent a year between 1982 \\nand 1992, Cape Town is one of the fastest growing cities in \\nAfrica. The African population of Cape Town more than trebled \\nbetween 1982 and 1992 from 200,000 in 1982 to more than 900,000 \\nin 1992 -- an increase of 350 percent. \\n  Despite widespread school disruptions, the survey records \\nthat the proportion of the population with standard six or more \\nincreased from 32.6 percent in 1985 to 37.4 percent in 1991. \\nThose with some form of post-matric education increased from 3 \\npercent in 1985 to 3.7 percent in 1991. \\n  The survey notes, however, that 3m people over the age of 18 \\n(10 percent of the population) have no schooling at all, while \\n1.4m (14 percent of the population of school-going age) are not \\nat school. \\n  The survey records that Zulu, Afrikaans and northern Sotho \\nare the most widely spoken home languages in the country and the \\nmajority of South Africans are Christians. Of these the largest \\nproportion (5.4m people) belong to African independent churches, \\nfollowed by the Dutch Reformed Church (3.2m people) and the \\nRoman Catholic Church (2.3m people). \\n  According to the World Bank, the survey notes, the pattern \\nof \\nurbanised land in South Africa is contributing to the \\ninefficiencies of its cities. This includes the spatial \\nseparation of (former) black and white cities, the high \\nconcentration of jobs and services in (former) white areas, and \\nthe location of high-density, low-income areas on the fringe of \\nthe cities. \\n  Recommended solutions include increasing the densities of \\nresidential areas (which would require a change in current \\nland-use zoning regulations) and concentrating settlements \\naround urban centres. \\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

ROSS WINTEROWD \\n(OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 226 PP.) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumerous writers in recent years have deplored the high rate of illiteracy in \\nthe United States and advocated political action to combat the problem. W. Ross \\nWinterowd approaches the problem from another perspective. What is literacy, he \\nasks. Is it the ability to read an employment application? The morning paper? \\nThe answer he proposes is that literacy is culturally determined. A practical \\napproach to increasing literacy, he argues, begins with an examination of what \\nis needed in this society at this time, how literacy is acquired and what it \\nmeans. \\n\\n\\nHe begins with a historical overview, pointing out that literacy has always \\nbeen an important political tool. He shows how various types of illiteracy are \\nlinked to certain mental abilities; introducing literacy necessarily changes \\nnot only a person\\'s social position, but also his way of thinking of \\ntraditional life. Using examples from his own teaching, Winterowd illustrates \\nhow the individual learns to read, both at the elementary level -- learning to \\nrecognize words -- and at the level of \"cultural literacy\" -- learning the \\nassociations that distinguish the simply literate person from the educated \\nperson. He also discusses the common neurological problems that interfere with \\nthe process of learning to read. \\n\\n\\nAlthough \"The Culture and Politics of Literacy\" proposes no easy solutions, it \\ndoes provide a thoughtful and clear look at a complex part of human life.

In the developing\\nworld, girls are still thought unlikely to contribute economically, and\\nreceive far less education than boys. In many cases their families do not\\nthink it is worth it, thwarting any attempt by the state to improve girls'\\nchances in life.\\nUnesco's figures on the school life expectancy - how long a child can expect\\nto stay in formal education - in different countries make depressing\\nreading. Africa south of the Sahara and southern Asia suffer the greatest\\nproblems.\\nIn the Saharan nation of Niger, girls can expect to stay 1.4 years in\\nschool, while boys do scarcely better with 2.8. In Guinea, girls can only\\nexpect 1.6 years in school, while in populous Bangladesh, boys receive 5.8\\nyears at school, compared with 4.2 for girls.\\nIn both Niger and Guinea, textbooks are available for less than 30 per cent\\nof primary school children, and the school year is short.\\nComparative figures show that Canadian girls can expect 16.5 years of formal\\neducation (a year more than their brothers). Both boys and girls devote more\\nthan 15 years to formal study in the US.\\nHowever, some parts of the developing world now provide as much education as\\nmember countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\\nDevelopment.\\nFor example, South Korea educates its children for an average of 13.3 years\\n -more than Australia, level with Japan and Sweden, and only slightly behind\\nthe UK. Several Latin American nations now have an educational life\\nexpectancy of more than a decade.\\nUnsurprisingly, low educational provision has led to illiteracy in later\\nlife, and according to Unesco, most adults in southern Asia and sub-Saharan\\nAfrica are illiterate. The total number of illiterate adults is still\\nincreasing in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab states, and in southern Asia.\\nHowever, the overall 'literacy gap' appears to be declining, as\\nbetter-educated children in other parts of the developing world reach\\nadulthood, and there is some confidence that much of the current disparity -\\nparticularly in sub-Saharan Africa - can be explained by the wide range of\\nlocal languages.\\nIn Ethiopia, for example, the education ministry has introduced the use of\\nfour nationality languages - Oromigna, Tigrigna, Sidamigna and Wolaitigna -\\nin primary schools, rather than the official language of Amharic.\\nThe reform should improve the standards of general education, because\\nchildren will be instructed in the language they use at home, but it may be\\nthat overall literacy statistics will prove harder to compute.\\nWhile problems with basic literacy and other skills may prevent emerging\\ngenerations from providing the 'engine room' of increased economic output\\nwhich developing countries need from them, disparities in higher education\\nmay in the short term be even more damaging.\\nLack of a developed higher education system critically damages\\ncompetitiveness, as it becomes impossible for a nation's industrial and\\nresearch and development communities to keep abreast with developments\\nelsewhere.\\nMost Latin American and Asian countries now have university enrolment levels\\nwhich conform broadly with university entries in the OECD nations - Unesco\\nreports show that sub-Saharan Africa is now alone in suffering from a\\n'higher education gap' by comparison with the rest of the world.\\nForeign exchange programmes account for a smaller proportion of students\\nthan they did 10 years ago, and most aid for developing countries now comes\\nthrough direct aid from banks and funds.

            "{'text': \"\\n940902\\n\\n\\nFT  02 SEP 94 / Falling prosperity hurts family planning\\n\\n\\nIn a continent where population growth outstrips economic growth, Nigeria at\\n90m people is by far the biggest nation in Africa.\\nUntil 1988, when Prof Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, then health minister, launched a\\nnational population policy, Nigerians had been so proud of their self-styled\\ntag as the 'giant of Africa' that, as long as the oil money rolled in, they\\nregarded high population growth as healthy and saw little point in\\ncontrolling the rate of growth.\\nNigeria was then believed to have at least 110m people, putting it among the\\n10 largest populations in the world. The 1991 census caused a surprise:\\nNigeria had only 88.5m. The over-estimate was a result of inflated numbers\\nby tribal chiefs and regional governors hoping to boost their political\\nclout and revenue allocation.\\nThe United Nations Population Fund has projected the average population\\ngrowth rate between 1990 and 1995 as 3.1 per cent (which would double the\\npopulation in about 30 years) with the birth rate at 45 per 1,000 persons\\nand death rate at 14 per 1,000 (including an infant mortality rate of 96).\\nThe UN estimates the fertility rate at 6.1 children per woman, while the\\nnational policy set a target of only four. Since the 1970s the urban\\npopulation has risen from 30 per cent to nearly half and the rate of growth\\nin the towns is higher at 5.5 per cent.\\nGeneralising about Nigeria, a country of over 200 ethnic groups and very\\ndiverse cultures, is often deceptive and never more so than in attitudes to\\neducation and the role of women.\\nIn the mainly Christian south, female education and literacy are far higher\\nthan in the predominantly Moslem north, where even the discussion of birth\\ncontrol is not widely accepted.\\nIn the south-east there is a high percentage of Catholics especially among\\nthe Ibo tribe. The alarming decline in social services during the 1990s has\\nhalted the progress towards family planning clinics and universal primary\\neducation, especially in the north, bolstering the influence of the Koranic\\nschools.\\nEven nationally, the UN paints a bleak picture. 'The status of women in\\nNigeria has improved little over the last decade. In general, they are\\nconsidered second-class citizens not by law but because of the social and\\ncultural climate', says the UNFPA's 1993 review of the national programme.\\nThe literacy rate for women was 31 per cent (54 per cent for men) and more\\nthan half of all Nigerian women were married at the age of 15.\\nThe problem of education lies not just with women. As a prominent women's\\ngroup in Nigeria points out, there may be a target of four children per\\nwoman, but in a polygamous society many men far exceed that figure.\\nIf the prospect of curtailing population growth is limited, the outlook for\\neconomic growth has become bleak. Despite the massive oil boom in the 1970s,\\nthe GDP income per capita is down to around Dollars 290, about the level of\\n1963. In the period, Indonesia has risen from a lower per capita income to a\\nlevel three times that of Nigeria.\\nIn January's budget speech the finance minister, Mr Kalu I Kalu, commented\\non three years of political uncertainty, capital flight government\\nover-spending, which 'resulted in a further decline in GDP growth rate from\\n4.8 per cent in 1991 to 2.9 per cent in 1993. A comparison with the average\\ngrowth rate of 5 per cent from 1988-91 demonstrates the enormity of the task\\ninvolved in resuscitating the economy in 1994 and beyond,' concluded Mr\\nKalu.\\nSince then strikes, shortages and a dearth of foreign exchange have taken\\nthe economy further down hill. Nigeria accounts for about half of West\\nAfrica's population and whereas Ghanaians once poured into Nigeria for a\\nbetter life, the chances of reverse migration look more likely.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

The 53 OAU member states are struggling with growing \\nforeign debts, which in 1993 amounted to 302 billion U.S. \\ndollars, or three times the figure in 1980. \\n  The unfavorable trade balance in 1993 reached as high as 1.6 \\nbillion U.S. dollars. In Africa alone, 33 belong to the 47 \\nleast developed countries in the world. \\n  Perhaps more devastating are Africa\\'s exploding population, \\nwhich now totals nearly 700 million. According to OAU \\nestimates, at the region\\'s current average annual growth rate of \\n3.1 percent, Africa\\'s population will reach approximately 1 \\nbillion by the year 2005. \\n  In the early years of the decade of the 1990s, the annual \\naverage growth rate of the GDP (gross domestic product) has been \\na mere 1.5 percent. This is barely half of the African \\npopulation growing the trend of continuing decline in per capita \\nincome and a further slide into poverty in Africa. \\n  It is evident that the most pressing issue is the resolution \\nof ethnic tension and conflict throughout the African continent. \\nAnd the second most important problem is finding ways and means \\nof combating the rising tide of economic problems. \\n  African conflicts and economic development will top the list \\nof concern on the agenda of the OAU summit from June 13 to 15. \\n  Given the changing international situation, it has become \\nincreasingly important for African countries to maintain \\npolitical stability for the benefit of economic development. \\n  In that light, the issue of assuring security for economic \\ndevelopment will appear to be the main theme of the African \\nsummit. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

WHILE 250,000 DESKS SIT \\nEMPTY IN WHITE SCHOOLS, ILL-EQUIPPED BLACK SCHOOLS ARE BULGING WITH UP TO A \\nMILLION TOO MANY STUDENTS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn those rare days this year when Soweto\\'s teachers haven\\'t been on strike or \\nthe pupils boycotting school, Fundi Vabaza has tried to teach business \\neconomics to 80 black youngsters squeezed into 30 desks in a classroom without \\nan overhead projector or even a textbook. \\n\\n\\nHere at Lamula High School, Vabaza says, \"You have to bank on their \\nimagination.\" \\n\\n\\nAt the whites-only Cape Town High School, where there hasn\\'t been a strike or a \\nboycott in memory, there are videocassette players, computers, copying \\nmachines, laboratories and more than enough textbooks to go around this year. \\n\\n\\nThere just aren\\'t enough students to fill all the desks. \\n\\n\\nThe result: \"We\\'re no longer able to maintain the school buses, the swimming \\npool and other facilities purchased when the school was bigger,\" says Nugent \\nField, the principal. \\n\\n\\nTwo typical high schools, one black and one white, supported unequally by the \\nsame government, tell the sad story of racially segregated education in South \\nAfrica. \\n\\n\\nAnd just as the black majority is being called on to join the political process \\nin South Africa, an entire generation of uneducated black youngsters is \\nwandering the township streets without jobs or skills. \\n\\n\\n\"We are sitting on some kind of time bomb,\" said Belede Mazwai, a Soweto high \\nschool teacher who recently quit in frustration. \"Very soon, the kids are going \\nto be taking over this country, and I\\'m frightened to think what will happen.\" \\n\\n\\nWhile 200 white schools have closed for lack of pupils in the last decade and \\n250,000 desks are still vacant, black schools are bulging with a million too \\nmany students. While white schools are stocked with all the teaching aids of a \\nmodern educational system, black schools lack the basics, from library books to \\ntest tubes to wall maps. \\n\\n\\nWhile white schools lay off highly trained teachers for lack of students, black \\nschools desperately scratch for more -- and better qualified -- teachers. About \\nhalf the teachers in black primary schools, and one-tenth of those in high \\nschools, have no high school diploma. \\n\\n\\nThe government recently said it might open some white schools next year to all \\nraces. But its conditions, including a requirement that 90% of the parents in \\neach school approve, doom that plan to failure, educators say. And even if all \\nthe white schools were integrated -- a move no one expects any time soon -- it \\nwould only begin to solve the problems. \\n\\n\\nThe report card for South Africa\\'s educational system comes as no surprise. \\nLast year, 96% of the country\\'s white high school seniors passed their \\ngraduation exams. The pass rate among blacks was 42%. In Soweto, the country\\'s \\nlargest black township, nine out of 10 seniors failed. \\n\\n\\nMost black parents blame the education crisis on the government, which spends \\nfive times more to educate a white child than a black child. But parents also \\nblame the anti-apartheid movement, which until a few weeks ago had spent 14 \\nyears trying to change the educational system by disrupting it. \\n\\n\\n\"We used to have a slogan, \\'Liberation before education,\\' \" said Thami \\nRubusana, a student activist who failed his graduation examination last year \\nand is back to try again this year. \"But we have begun to see you cannot \\nseparate education from liberation. Just because it\\'s an apartheid education \\ndoesn\\'t mean it\\'s all rotten.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMandela\\'s Message \\n\\n\\nNelson Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, has been \\ntrying to deliver that message to students since his release from prison Feb. \\n11. \\n\\n\\nMore schools, more teachers and better facilities are needed, he told a recent \\npolitical rally. But \"the tactic of boycott cannot hope to win our battles,\" he \\nadded. \"Our stayaways and school boycotts are giving the education department \\none long public holiday.\" \\n\\n\\nNot everyone has listened, however, and frustration with the educational system \\nbubbled over soon after President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the lid on black \\nprotest in February. \\n\\n\\nIn Soweto and Alexandra townships, for example, 6,000 teachers organized by an \\nANC-aligned union staged a \"chalks-down\" that had the wide support of student \\nactivists. For four weeks, teachers went to school every day but refused to \\nlift a piece of chalk to the blackboard in protest over low wages, heavy \\nschedules and textbook shortages. \\n\\n\\n\"Teachers have been silenced by the government for a very long time,\" said \\nCurtis Nkondo, president of the National Education Union of South Africa, which \\nrepresents the teachers. \"Now that they have a chance of expressing themselves, \\nthey don\\'t have the patience.\" \\n\\n\\nNkondo argues that education will never be politically neutral in South Africa \\nbecause the government uses it to dominate blacks, and the anti-apartheid \\nmovement now is using it to fight domination. \\n\\n\\n\"We have to make use of our weapons,\" Nkondo said. \\n\\n\\nThe Soweto teachers strike was suspended Wednesday with a government promise to \\ntry to meet their demands for salary increases and for more teachers. But the \\nstrike, pupil boycotts and impromptu holidays such as Mandela\\'s release from \\nprison already had taken a toll. Of 64 school days on the calendar since \\nJanuary, school has been in session for only four. \\n\\n\\nThe government contends that it is beginning to improve black schooling and it \\nhas set aside $100 million to build black schools this year. But education \\nexperts say South Africa would need to open 300 new schools every year to keep \\nup with the growing black student population and triple its annual school \\nbudget to give blacks and whites an equal education. \\n\\n\\n\"There is still a hell of a job to be done,\" acknowledged Stoffel van der \\nMerwe, the government official who oversees black education. \\n\\n\\nLamula High School, where Vabaza teaches, sits in the middle of Soweto, a \\ntownship of 2.5 million people and 280 public schools. For years the heart of \\nblack activism has beat strongest in this hometown of such famous nationalist \\nleaders as Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu. \\n\\n\\nIt was here that tens of thousands of students took to the streets on June 16, \\n1976, to protest the government insistence that arithmetic and social studies \\nbe taught in Afrikaans, the language of the Dutch-descended white settlers. \\n\\n\\nThe government backed down on Afrikaans, but not before dozens of protesting \\nchildren were killed by police bullets in roiling South African townships, and \\nthe students\\' struggle against apartheid education was born. \\n\\n\\n\"All the battles today are being fought by the children, because they say the \\nadults are becoming too cautious,\" said Wilkie Khambule, who resigned as \\nprincipal of Orlando High School in Soweto in 1976 to protest the police \\naction. \"The child of yesteryear accepted that the white person had the \\nadvantage. But the present child doesn\\'t see why the white child has an \\nadvantage.\" \\n\\n\\nKhambule, now principal of Pace Community College, admires the student \\nactivism, but he laments \"the tremendous waste of human resources.\" \\n\\n\\n\"I tell my students that if they use the present circumstances as excuses not \\nto study, they are going to be sorry,\" Khambule said. \"If there is any change \\nin the country, they won\\'t be able to sit at the table because they won\\'t be \\nprepared.\" \\n\\n\\nBut Michael Dube, an 18-year-old Soweto student leader, says he and his fellow \\nstudents are prepared to \"sacrifice our education for the sake of the country. \\nIf we don\\'t push, history won\\'t forgive us.\" \\n\\n\\nA few weeks ago, the authorities declared Lamula High School\\'s drab, \\nprefabricated classrooms uninhabitable. Doors had been stolen from their hinges \\nand holes punched through the walls. The 1,400 students were forced into three \\nprimary school buildings. \\n\\n\\nOne blackboard in the deserted high school still carries the chalked markings \\nof an algebra problem. The classroom graffiti celebrate both black militancy \\nand black hope. In small, penciled letters on one wall is the saying: \"I know \\nI\\'m somebody cos God makes no junk.\" \\n\\n\\nThe conditions for Lamula High\\'s pupils and teachers did not change much with \\nthe move. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeated Five to a Desk \\n\\n\\nVabaza\\'s class in Xhosa, an African language, has 101 students, seated five to \\na desk. There are no laboratory facilities, only a handful of textbooks and no \\nbooks in the library. Assigning homework without books is impossible, she said, \\nand because there is no mimeograph machine, her classes spend hours copying \\npassages of the book from the blackboard. \\n\\n\\n\"The type of education we are giving kids now is useless,\" Vabaza said. \"It\\'s \\njust the same as no teaching at all. But you always feel guilty when students \\nfail.\" \\n\\n\\nOf 100 Lamula students who took the high school graduation exam last year, only \\n12 passed and only four of those scored high enough to qualify for university \\nentrance. \\n\\n\\nAlthough students may be failing the course work, many have quickly learned \\nthat mass action is a potent way to get what they want in school. Black \\nstudents today are increasingly dictating when and what they will learn, and \\nprincipals and teachers who refuse to knuckle under to \"people\\'s education\" \\nhave been driven out. \\n\\n\\n\"Students are exposed to politics, and if you as a teacher try to turn a blind \\neye to that, it creates a lot of problems,\" said Mary Selebogo, another Soweto \\nteacher. \\n\\n\\nIn that and myriad other ways, white schools bear little resemblance to black \\nschools in South Africa. White schools are run by parents\\' boards, and student \\npower never extends beyond the purely advisory role of the student council. \\n\\n\\nCape Town High School, a short walk from the offices of Parliament, is not \\namong the richest white schools in the country. Nevertheless, the contrast with \\nmost black schools is readily apparent. \\n\\n\\nThe freshly painted white building with its red tile roof and hardwood floors \\nhas an intercom system for the principal\\'s daily announcements, a full library, \\na home economics classroom with ovens and stoves, science laboratories stocked \\nwith glassware, and acres of neatly clipped sports fields. Students dressed in \\nthe school\\'s green and white colors all carry shoulder bags stuffed with books. \\nDates and sports and even homework, not politics, are the favored topics of \\nhallway conversation. \\n\\n\\n\"Obviously, one never reaches perfection,\" said Field, the principal. \"But I \\nthink the standard of education is very high here, and we have a lot to be \\nhappy for.\" \\n\\n\\nField\\'s biggest worry is enrollment. Four years ago he had 600 pupils in the \\nschool\\'s five grades. Today that figure is 300. At least four of the nearest \\nwhite schools face similar problems resulting from emigration, low birthrates \\nand the growing popularity of private schools among whites. \\n\\n\\nNo class at Cape Town High has more than 30 students, and some are as small as \\nfour. Ten teachers have left and have not been replaced, the school dropped its \\nrugby team for lack of players and it is phasing out two subjects -- Xhosa and \\nbusiness economics. \\n\\n\\nFewer students means less money for the parents\\' board to spend. Although the \\ngovernment pays for teacher salaries and books, white schools in South Africa \\nraise money from extra student fees and parent-teacher associations to maintain \\ntheir swimming pools, school buses and sports grounds. At Cape Town High, each \\nstudent pays about $30 each term. \\n\\n\\nOpening Cape Town High to all races would help solve the enrollment problem and \\nmany parents and students support the idea. \\n\\n\\n\"As long as I get my education, that\\'s all that matters to me,\" said Darryn \\nHavenga, 15. Many parents agree, although they also are concerned \"that \\nstandards be maintained,\" Field said. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow Private Schools \\n\\n\\nSeveral white schools have rescued themselves by becoming private schools, \\nwhich allows them to open their doors to blacks, Indians and people of mixed \\nrace. But in the process the schools lose substantial state subsidies, and the \\nstudents must pay thousands of dollars in tuition. \\n\\n\\nThe government recently suggested that some white schools could become \\nmultiracial beginning next year if 90% of the school\\'s parents agree. Cape Town \\nHigh is one of 20 schools that wants to become \"open,\" but no one knows if it \\ncan muster the approval of that many parents. \\n\\n\\nIn 1953, Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the architects of apartheid, first set out \\nthe government philosophy behind black education when he created a central \\ngovernment department in charge of \"Bantu education,\" taking away all the \\nautonomy black schools had enjoyed. \\n\\n\\nUnder that new system, Verwoerd said, \"Natives (blacks) will be taught from \\nchildhood that equality with Europeans (whites) is not for them.\" \\n\\n\\nVan der Merwe, the current white minister of black education, says the \\ngovernment has abandoned those old policies and is trying to upgrade black \\neducation. But he believes that segregated schools still are best for South \\nAfrica because of the differing \"cultural needs\" of blacks and whites. \\n\\n\\nBesides, he added, with the \"huge differential between white and black \\neducation, if we immediately integrated everything it would create tremendous \\nchaos.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nFebruary 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHIGH BIRTH RATE THREATENS TO WIPE OUT AFRICA\\'S MODEST GAINS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nElizabeth Mazivire, a 16-year-old mother of three, works in the tobacco barn of \\na wealthy Zimbabwean farmer to supplement the earnings of her tractor-driver \\nhusband. \\n\\n\\nHer eldest son, Peter, is only 4 years old. \\n\\n\\nWeary, and looking far older than her age, Elizabeth says she \"accidentally \\nfell pregnant\" at 12 and since then has continued having accidental pregnancies \\nby her 20-year-old husband, Jonathan. \\n\\n\\nShe is one of thousands of Zimbabwean women who, either because they do not \\nknow about contraceptives or have no access to them, end up having more \\nchildren than planned. \\n\\n\\nZimbabwe, with only 9 million people in a country the size of France, hardly \\nranks as overcrowded. But here, as almost everywhere in Africa, a high birth \\nrate is threatening to wipe out modest gains from economic growth. \\n\\n\\nZimbabwe and neighboring Botswana have been spotlighted by the World Bank as \\nthe only two countries in sub-Saharan Africa where vigorous government efforts \\nto promote family planning are starting to show results. \\n\\n\\nAbout 40% of Zimbabwean couples now use contraceptives -- about 10 times the \\nAfrican average, according to the World Bank. Only Mauritius, an Indian Ocean \\nisland not typical of Africa, scores higher, with 78%. \\n\\n\\nEven so, Zimbabwe is still fighting an uphill battle against the African \\ntradition of large families. \\n\\n\\nBetween 1980 and 1987 the net population growth was 3.7%, although the latest \\nfigures show a drop to 2.9%. World Bank statistics show that as recently as \\n1988, the average Zimbabwean woman could expect to give birth to five children \\nin her lifetime. \\n\\n\\nPopulation growth has far outpaced Zimbabwe\\'s annual average economic growth \\nrate of 2.4% since independence in 1980, according to World Bank statistics. \\n\\n\\nThis has led to an average drop in the per capita gross domestic product of \\n1.3% a year, with falling living standards, growing unemployment and increased \\npressure on social services. \\n\\n\\nIn much of Africa the figures are far worse. World Bank projections foresee a \\ndoubling of the continent\\'s population to 1 billion in the next 30 years, and \\nat the moment only 3% to 4% of couples use contraception. \\n\\n\\nIn Zimbabwe accidental pregnancies are most prevalent among schoolgirls who, \\nfor moral reasons, are barred by the authorities from freely obtaining \\ncontraceptives like their married and adult counterparts. \\n\\n\\nBut teen-agers and couples who do not use any form of modern contraception for \\ncultural, religious and other reasons are now the main targets of a \\nstate-backed family planning program. \\n\\n\\nThe Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council has expanded its activities since \\nindependence to almost every town and has established a rural network in which \\ncontraceptives are given freely to couples and unmarried adults. \\n\\n\\n\"We are the nerve center of the country\\'s population control strategy,\" said a \\nspokeswoman of the council, which gets 70% of its funds from the government. \\n\\n\\nThe council holds lectures for couples on why and how to space their children \\nand counseling sessions for young people on the consequences of early marriage. \\n\\n\\nHowever, the campaign to persuade families to have fewer children has yet to \\nreach every corner of the country, particularly isolated rural areas where 80% \\nof Zimbabwe\\'s population lives. \\n\\n\\nElizabeth, for example, despite living on a farm only 40 miles from the \\ncapital, said she had never heard of contraceptives until \"a few weeks ago, \\nwhen I went to Harare for specialized medical treatment.\" \\n\\n\\n\"I wish I knew there was this (contraceptives) and I think I couldn\\'t have \\nfallen pregnant in the first place and I could have been in school now,\" she \\nsaid with a wry smile. \\n\\n\\nRural families, who rely on children to work on their farms, have an average of \\neight children. Before the advent of modern medical care, infant mortality \\nencouraged women to have a large number of pregnancies to ensure that several \\nchildren survived. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

In the west, the humble telephone is taken for\\ngranted. In Africa, the few that do exist are expensive to use.\\nCheap local calls are an important feature of western countries, while\\ninternational rates, although pricey, are within the budgets of most people.\\nBy comparison, local calls in most African countries are expensive.\\nThe other building block of today's information technology (IT) revolution\\nis the personal computer. The PC is a window to the modern communications\\nworld; but it is difficult to talk of a 'personal' computer in the African\\ncontext. For example, Zimbabwe, a relatively developed African country, has\\nonly 10,000 microcomputers. In Zambia, a PC would cost six years' wages.\\nThe 1993 edition of Telegeography, which tracks communications around the\\nworld, reveals their uneven global distribution. Tunisia has the only\\nInternet host computer in Africa (excluding South Africa). In the entire\\nAfrican continent, only South Africa appears under Telegeography's national\\ntelecommunication indicators. The rest of Africa is so lacking in telephone\\nlines, Internet host computers, mobile phones and fax machines that it does\\nnot even feature.\\nAt a time when IT is becoming integral to every area of western society,\\nthere is a danger that the developing countries will become further\\nmarginalised and impoverished.\\nIn all the fervour that greets each new advance in communications\\ntechnology, the very partial application of IT in Africa has, in effect,\\ncreated a digital fence around many of its regions. Instead of helping the\\ndeveloping countries overcome the gap between north and south, IT appears to\\nbe applied in a way that will cut them off from the more advanced economy of\\nthe developed nations.\\nYet during the 1950s and 1960s, communication technologies were seen as an\\nessential counterpoint to decolonisation. Radio, telecommunications and\\ntelevision were supposed to assist in restructuring unequal relations\\nbetween north and south.\\nThe US, after the Cold War, no longer feels the need to win hearts and minds\\nin developing countries. Although South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are\\neagerly being plugged into the global networks by multinational companies,\\nAfrica is largely an IT desert.\\nWe are witnessing the creation of a new, more marginalised 'Third World'.\\nThis is a great shame because, potentially, IT could be used to close the\\ngap with the developed world. Computers, perhaps provided under\\ninternational investment programmes, could help to develop more modern\\nindustries or generate models for better understanding of climatology to\\nhelp improve agricultural production.\\nEmmanuel Ohajah is an information technology consultant.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

Real incomes per head have\\ngrown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent\\na year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began.\\nWorld Bank officials argue that Ghana shows that adjustment, if properly\\npursued, need not mean greater poverty or fiscal austerity. The share of tax\\nrevenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. And the sketchy evidence, according\\nto Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on\\naverage, adjustment has shifted resources from the richer urban areas to the\\npoorer, rural regions.\\nNor can this growth record be explained by aid flows alone. Ghana remains\\nheavily dependent on gross aid flow, totalling 8 per cent of GDP a year.\\nBut, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses, the net resource\\ntransfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared with a\\nsub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent.\\nThere is another factor in Ghana's success, which World Bank officials\\nprefer not to talk about: politics. Ghana's former military government has\\nconsistently tried to align its interests with the rural poor. The\\ngovernment also built an impressive record, over 10 years, before putting\\nits popularity to the test at last autumn's elections.\\nGhana's record does seem to show that structural adjustment is necessary for\\nan acceleration in economic growth. But it also demonstrates that successful\\nstructural adjustment is insufficient for an accelerated growth and a rapid\\nfall in poverty. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for\\npopulation) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower\\nmiddle-income countries.\\nThe government plans to accelerate its growth rate to 8 per cent a year over\\nthe next decade, but it lags far behind its east Asian competition in all\\nareas of social and physical infrastructure, and the civil service is weak.\\nMeanwhile, the domestic economy remains heavily dependent on a narrow\\ncommodity base for export earnings, manufacturing exports are tiny, foreign\\ninvestment minimal. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in\\nGhana in 1990, compared with 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32\\nper cent in Thailand.

But while it stresses the need for 'good governance' in\\nAfrica, the report does not elaborate on either the measures required, or\\nassess its impact on economic performance in the years under review.\\nOf the 29 countries studied in the report, the six with the most improvement\\nin macroeconomic policies between 1981-86 and 1987-91 enjoyed the strongest\\nresurgence in economic performance, with an average annual growth of 2 per\\ncent in GDP.\\nBy contrast, says the report, countries that did not improve their policies\\nsaw their GDP decline by 2 per cent a year, in all likelihood increasing the\\nnumber of poor.\\nAlthough the outcomes are 'encouraging' they are not as positive as they\\nmight be. Current growth rates among the best African performers are still\\ntoo low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades.\\n'So far the rebounds have merely bought countries back to their historical\\ntrend of low growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto\\na higher growth path.\\n'Without further substantial increases in agricultural, investment, export\\nand GDP growth, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to lag behind other\\ndeveloping nations.'\\nThe report examines the relationship between economic policy and growth in\\nsub Saharan Africa, by comparing the performances of 29 countries during two\\nperiods: 1981-86, when the region was in economic crisis but few countries\\nwere implementing economic reforms, and in 1987-91 when most African\\ngovernments had adopted World Bank supported structural adjustment\\nprogrammes.\\nThe six leading reformers reduced budget deficits, curbed inflation,\\nintroduced competitive exchange rates, tariff reforms and agricultural\\nincentives.\\nCountries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture\\nhave seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops,\\nsays the Bank.\\nThe study 'also shows that it is not always true that devaluation\\nnecessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were\\ncomplementing policies of wage, fiscal and monetary restraint . . . and\\nindeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market.'\\nExport volumes increased significantly, despite declining terms of trade, if\\nthe exchange rate, agricultural pricing and marketing liberalisation polies\\nwere implemented, says the report.\\nComparing Africa and other developing regions, the Bank says: 'It is\\nworrisome that even the best performers in Africa do not come close to\\nmatching the good macroeconomic policies typified by Chile, Malaysia, Mexico\\nand Thailand, where inflation is close to 10 per cent a year, budget\\nbalances range from deficits of 2 per cent of GDP to small surpluses and\\ncurrencies are fully convertible, at least for current account\\ntransactions.'\\nAfrican governments are criticised for slow progress in privatisation. 'The\\nvalue of privatisations in Nigeria between 1988 and 1992,' says the Bank,\\n'was less than 1 per cent of that in Argentina, Malaysia or Mexico, even\\nafter adjusting for Nigeria's smaller GDP.'\\nAfrica's financial sector is still 'heavily burdened' by public sector\\ndemands for credits, says the Bank. Central governments alone (excluding\\npublic enterprises) absorb more than 30 per cent of domestic credit.\\n'There is substantially more room for improving policies,' said Mr Kim\\nJaycox, the Bank vice president for Africa, at a press conference in\\nWashington to launch the study.\\n'Macroeconomic policies deteriorated in a third of the countries, and no\\ncountry has achieved a first rate macroeconomic policy stance - low\\ninflation, very low budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate,' he\\nsaid.\\nAfrica performs particularly poorly in comparison with other developing\\ncountries.\\nIn 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is\\nthree times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than\\nGhana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.\\nThe report notes Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of\\nfood and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to\\n8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. The high rate of\\npopulation growth - more than 3 per cent a year - strains the limited\\nresources available.\\nAdjustment programmes can establish a framework for sound investment and\\nefficient resource use, but are no substitute for long-term development\\nefforts to build the capabilities of Africa's people by putting adequate\\nresources into education and strengthening weak management capacity.\\n'Emphasis on universal primary education is the key to achieving rapid\\ngrowth in the best performing Asian economies,' says the bank.\\nOther central policy measures which are vital include the need to accelerate\\ndivestiture programmes and develop financial sectors. Reducing Africa's\\nexternal debt burden and maintaining aid flows 'is essential', says the Bank\\n'but debt relief and aid only make sense if sound economic reform programmes\\nare in place.\\nAdjustment in Africa: Reforms, Results and the Road Ahead, World Bank, 1818\\nH Street, Washington\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTHE VIEW FROM THE WORLD BANK OVER 14 YEARS\\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1994\\nCurrent growth rates among the best African performers are still too low\\nto reduce poverty much in the next two decades.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nNovember 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAFRICA -- THE FINAL WORD; \\n\\n\\nNOTED BOOK COLLECTION, ONE OF WORLD\\'S BEST, BEING SOLD OFF BY EX-CALTECH \\nPROFESSOR \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more than 40 years, Ned Munger stalked books about Africa the way safari \\nhunters stalk big game. \\n\\n\\nOften, the thrill was in the pursuit. \\n\\n\\nOnce, while crawling on his hands and knees along the cold concrete-floor \\nbasement of a Zurich bookshop in the early 1960s, the former Caltech professor \\nheard what sounded like a huge rat gnawing at a book. \\n\\n\\nHe peered cautiously into the next aisle. And there was his old pal Nnamdi \\nAzikwe, then-president of Nigeria, also on his hands and knees, gazing intently \\nat contents on the dusty lower shelves. \\n\\n\\n\"He, too, knew that hit-and-miss collectors will often . . . leave the real \\ngems unmined on the less-convenient lower shelves,\" Munger recalled. \\n\\n\\nIt took Munger more than four decades of haunting bookstores on six continents \\nto build up a collection of 45,000 volumes on Africa, the largest such private \\nlibrary in the United States, says Moore Crossey, curator of the African \\nCollection at Yale University\\'s library. \\n\\n\\nBut the professor retired last year and Caltech, which housed the books, says \\nit can no longer accommodate his library. Neither can Munger, whose Pasadena \\nhome will hold only a fraction of his collection. \\n\\n\\nSo Munger, 67, has been forced to break up what many scholars have called a \\nunique cultural resource. \\n\\n\\n\"It really was invaluable,\" said Richard L. Sklar, a professor of political \\nscience at UCLA and former president of the Atlanta-based national African \\nStudies Assn. \"I\\'m so sorry to hear it\\'s being broken up. So many scholars have \\nused it from all over the world.\" \\n\\n\\nAt first Munger had hoped to sell his library in one piece, but many \\nuniversities already owned some tomes and didn\\'t want to duplicate their \\nholdings. \\n\\n\\nHe donated about 8,900 books to Caltech. Several hundred more were sold at a \\ndiscount to Occidental College and Pasadena City College. Others were purchased \\nby antiquarian book dealers in far-flung places like Sydney, Australia, and \\nJohannesburg, South Africa. \\n\\n\\nNow he is down to one-quarter of his original collection. Another 1,000 of his \\nrarest books will go on the auction block beginning todayat Sotheby\\'s in \\nLondon. \\n\\n\\nMunger did not reveal how much the books have sold for, but he noted that one \\nbookseller said the estimated worth of the entire collection \"probably \\napproaches seven figures.\" \\n\\n\\nMunger says he has few regrets about breaking up his collection. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s like when a child grows up and goes to college; it\\'s a part of life,\" \\nsays Munger, who hopes his 45,000 \"children\" will all find good homes. \\n\\n\\nOne of Munger\\'s most prized possessions is a scrap of paper that bears what the \\nprofessor calls the only known signature of Cetywayo, the last great King of \\nthe Zulus, who trounced the British in South Africa in 1879, wiping out an \\nentire British regiment. \\n\\n\\nWhen a later Zulu king visited Munger, and saw the rare signature, \"he broke \\ninto tears\" Munger recalled. \\n\\n\\nMunger\\'s library includes rare political pamphlets written in 1912 by South \\nAfrican communists. It also includes first editions of \"Cry The Beloved \\nCountry,\" by the anti-apartheid South African author Alan Paton, a friend of \\nMunger. \\n\\n\\nIt includes 15th-Century illuminated manuscripts on vellum written in Geez, the \\nliturgical language of the \\n\\n\\nEthiopian Coptic Church; there is a letter signed by Dr. David Livingstone \\ndated 1861 and a document signed by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who \\nsailed around the Cape of Good Hope to India in the late 1490s, opening the \\nfirst all-water trade route between Europe and Asia. \\n\\n\\nOne collection that Munger didn\\'t snap up was a cache of 200 letters that \\nMahatma Gandhi wrote to an architect friend while living in Durban. At $20,000, \\nMunger thought it too pricey. But he often sought out rare publications and \\nmanuscripts that dealt with the history of the Indian people in Africa, who \\n\"played an extremely important role in developing the economic history of East \\nAfrica,\" Munger says. \\n\\n\\nDuring the 1930s, when he was growing up in Chicago, however, Munger didn\\'t \\nknow Durban from Timbuktu. But he did have a penchant for book collecting, \\noften trading candy to neighborhood children in exchange for books. \\n\\n\\nSome years later, while he was in the Army, Munger showed an aptitude for \\npoker. When he hit the jackpot one night in 1947, he took his winnings and \\nheaded for West Africa -- a place that had long conjured up visions of exotic \\nadventure. \\n\\n\\nThus began a lifelong fascination with Africa, one that led eventually to a \\ndoctorate in political geography from the University of Chicago, a role in \\nfounding the national African Studies Assn. and a 14-year stint as president of \\nthe L.S.B. Leakey Foundation, the Pasadena-based organization founded by \\narcheologists Louis and Mary Leakey which supports scientific research into the \\norigins of man. \\n\\n\\nWhile completing his Ph.D and looking for an academic home, Munger realized \\nthat few libraries in the United States had sizable Africana collections. Bent \\non teaching students about Africa, he decided to build up a collection that \\ncould both serve as a teaching tool and make him a welcome addition to any \\nfaculty. \\n\\n\\nWhen Caltech offered him one of its few humanities professorships in 1959, he \\nagreed, so long as he could take along his \"laboratory.\" \\n\\n\\nDuring the decades that he taught \"The Politics of Africa\" to science majors at \\nCaltech, Munger\\'s podium served as a revolving door for visiting lecturers that \\nincluded the foreign minister of Tanzania, the president of Gambia, and South \\nAfrican critics of apartheid. \\n\\n\\nIndeed, Munger has met just about every important person in recent African \\nhistory, including the noted Nigerian social realist writer Chinua Achebe and \\nthe notorious tyrant and former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, who had been a \\nbellboy in a hotel where Munger once stayed in Kampala. Amin, an amateur boxer, \\nwas so big and brutish that he could knock out two men at once, and proved it \\nduring fights that the British set up, Munger recalled. \\n\\n\\nAfter 76 trips to Africa, Munger concludes that \"the people are the most \\nexciting in West Africa, the scenery is the most inspiring in East Africa and \\nthe problems are the most challenging in South Africa.\" \\n\\n\\nBook collecting proved challenging too, an occupation ill-suited for weak-kneed \\nbookworms. \\n\\n\\nMunger says he has been shot at by a Cuban MIG fighter plane in Angola and held \\nupside-down over a cliff in Sao Tome -- an island in the South Atlantic -- by \\nPortuguese secret police who mistook him for a revolutionary. Another close \\ncall came in 1960 when the Belgians began pulling out of the Congo (now Zaire). \\nMunger was walking down the street with an Israeli colonel in Leopoldville -- \\nnow Kinshasa -- when, briefly after parting ways, the colonel was shot in the \\nhead by guerrilla snipers. \\n\\n\\nBibliophiles say Munger himself played an important role in African \\nscholarship, beginning with his doctoral thesis: a history of Monrovia, the \\ncapital of Liberia, the African country founded in 1847 by freed U.S. slaves. \\n\\n\\nMunger\\'s library \"has a lot of unique, interesting and very, very scarce \\npolitical material, especially about South Africa,\" said Crossey, curator of \\nYale\\'s African Collection. \\n\\n\\nToday, Munger devotes most of his time to the Cape of Good Hope Foundation, a \\nPasadena-based organization he founded in 1984 to provide college educations in \\nSouth Africa to promising poor and underprivileged minority students. \\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, some academics who have enhanced their own collections with Munger\\'s \\nbooks are of two minds about the dismantling of his library. \\n\\n\\n\"On one hand, it\\'s a pity because it was put together by the vision of one \\nindividual,\" said Gerald J. Bender, director of the school of international \\nrelations at USC. \\n\\n\\nBut then again, \"If it\\'s going to be better utilized, then perhaps that should \\nbe its fate.\" \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n930901\\n\\n\\nFT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (16): Killer virus\\nhits at heart of economy - AIDS / More than half of the world's 15m\\nsufferers are in Africa\\n\\n\\nTWELVE YEARS after the world first woke up to the consequences of Aids,\\nsub-Saharan Africa remains in the grip of the disease, and many fear its\\neconomic impact threatens to reverse the continent's development well into\\nthe next century.\\nFigures from the World Health Organisation show that more than half of the\\nworld's 15m sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m\\nAfricans, and it is estimated 14m of the region's people will be infected by\\n2000.\\nThe disease in Africa is mainly transmitted through heterosexual contact,\\naffecting men and women equally. Figures for each country remain patchy, but\\nAids-control programmes in Uganda suggest between 7 and 10 per cent of the\\npopulation is infected with HIV. In Zambia, the ministry of health estimates\\nbetween 20 and 25 per cent of Zambian women of child-bearing age have HIV.\\nThe problem is believed to be growing in West Africa and in South Africa.\\nAccording to the World Bank, in many African countries, particularly in the\\nurban areas, Aids has become the 'major cause of adult mortality, leading to\\na doubling and even a tripling of the adult mortality rate'. In Africa, the\\ndisease is concentrated in the 20-45 age group, the strongest section of the\\nlabour force, and many now fear labour shortages will become widespread on\\nthe continent - leading to rising employment costs, which could impede\\ndevelopment.\\nThe increasing incidence of tuberculosis, which has killed more than 1.3m\\npeople since 1980, has also been linked to the increase in Aids, with nearly\\n50 per cent of sufferers said to be HIV-infected.\\nExperts now believe there is a real danger that the disease will derail\\nattempts in recent years by African governments to restructure their\\neconomies.\\nIn rural areas, the backbone of many African economies, the disease has had\\na devastating impact. A report for Panos, the research charity, by Tony\\nBarnet, of the University of East Anglia, said in many parts of southern\\nUganda (an area once known for its fertility), HIV-related illness and death\\nhad resulted in less careful tending of banana plots, unpruned coffee\\nbushes, a reduction in the size of cultivated plots and a narrowing in the\\nrange of crops.\\nIn parts of Zimbabwe, the cultivation of Chilli peppers had grown at the\\nexpense of more lucrative crops - it needs less energy for harvesting - and,\\nas Panos says, 'in Rwanda, the long-term effects may be increased\\ncultivation of cassava and reduced cultivation of other foods and cash\\ncrops'. This in turn could lead to less export income and poor nutrition.\\nIn parts of Tanzania, agricultural production is said to have fallen by\\nbetween 3 and 20 per cent, due to HIV-related deaths. In addition, says the\\nrecent World Bank report, 'the viability of agricultural credit schemes may\\nalso be affected. The number of defaulters may rise, as households use\\ncredit to finance medical care, leaving survivors to liquidate their\\nremaining assets in order to repay loans'.\\nBut it is perhaps in the urban areas and more formal sectors of the economy\\nthat the impact of Aids is most visible.\\nIn many urban centres, the infection rate has been put as high as 30 per\\ncent. Ironically, the higher the income, the greater the sexual activity,\\nand a 1988 study in Zaire found higher HIV rates among better-educated and\\nhigher-paid workers.\\nIn industry, whole sectors are under threat. In Zambia, where the copper\\nindustry is the source of 75 per cent of export earnings, researchers have\\nnot only warned that workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids\\nfaster than replacements can be trained, but have added: 'The result will\\nnot be a sudden collapse in minor output; rather there will be a slow but\\nsteady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents, and delays and\\noutput will suffer.'\\nIn other countries, the loss of output and earnings in manufacturing due to\\nHIV/Aids illness have become apparent with the decline in production levels.\\nThe service sector has not escaped either, and Panos highlights the\\nsituation in South Africa where life insurance companies face a huge\\nincrease in payments. Aids-related claims in the period 1985 to 1988\\namounted to Pounds 855,000. Yet in 1989 alone the figure was Pounds 700,000.\\nProductivity levels have been hit across the continent, due to ill-health\\namong workers and funeral attendance. An official at the Uganda ministry of\\ncommerce and industry said last year: 'Even if someone does not die here,\\nevery week we have at least three employees asking for permission to attend\\na relative's funeral.'\\nAccording to forecaster DRI/McGraw Hill, Aids will see Africa's gross\\ndomestic product depressed by more than 4 per cent by the end of the decade.\\nCompanies have already taken action. BP's African subsidiary has a formal\\n'common agreed policy' on Aids written into its employee handbook. Unilever,\\nwith 80,000 employees on the continent, has 'guidelines rather than a formal\\npolicy', and takes an active monitoring and educational role in relation to\\nAids. British American Tobacco in Uganda subjects its workforce, or even\\nprospective employees, to blood tests. The South African Chamber of Mines is\\nreported to have refused to recruit anyone who reacts positively to a test.\\nThe World Bank adopted an Agenda for Action on Aids in Africa, in 1988, and\\nhas loaned more than Dollars 100m in its fight against the condition and\\nother sexually-transmitted diseases since 1986. That total includes its\\nsingle biggest loan for fighting Aids, totalling Dollars 64.5m, which it\\ngave to Zimbabwe in June.\\nIf Africa is to fight the scourge, more assistance is vital.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n930901\\n\\n\\nFT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (1): Africa is\\nstriving for a fresh start - Four years after the World Bank's seminal 1989\\nreport, the continent's crisis is deepening and more children are dying\\n\\n\\nNOT SINCE the end of colonial rule, some three decades ago, has Africa been\\ngripped by such a fundamental struggle. At stake is the fate of a continent\\nbattling for economic recovery against mounting odds.\\nOver the past handful of years, the old order has collapsed, or is on its\\nlast legs. Apartheid has crumbled. Dictators have been overthrown, democracy\\nsought, and state-controlled economies have succumbed to the market.\\nAs the world itself changed, African presidents lost the patronage of Moscow\\nand Washington, and donors demanded 'good governance' from previously\\ntolerated corrupt or mismanaged regimes.\\nFrom Lagos to Lusaka, the mood of the continent has altered dramatically as\\nAfrica has entered a new era. Africans have fewer inhibitions about\\ncriticising their governments, and they speak out more confidently for human\\nrights and against corruption.\\nAbove all, they debate what is critical to their future: structural\\nadjustment - as powerful in its impact as any ideology the countries of\\nsub-Saharan Africa have adopted. Drawn up by the World Bank, endorsed by\\nother official donors and the IMF, criticised by many non-government\\norganisations, and often bitterly attacked within the region itself, it\\nshapes the lives of more than 600m Africans.\\nYet some 10 years after its inception, the results are modest. As articles\\nelsewhere in this survey suggest, the business environment in Africa has\\nchanged for the better. But in its crucial forthcoming review of adjustment\\nin Africa, provisionally entitled Progress, Payoffs and Challenges, the Bank\\nis expected to warn that progress falls short of expectations.\\nImplementation by governments has been weak, the obstacles formidable, the\\ntime required longer than expected, the results modest, and elements of the\\nprogramme flawed.\\nThe report is guarded in its conclusions. But the insights it provides,\\ntogether with the experiences of FT writers on the ground, point to a sombre\\nconclusion: structural adjustment, while essential to Africa's recovery, is\\nnot sufficient. The African crisis is outpacing efforts to resolve it.\\nFor millions in the region, the new era is associated with pain. Factories\\nhave been closed, food subsidies eliminated, social services cut, as\\ngovernments seek to live within their means. The poor are the first to\\nsuffer. 'Structural maladjustment is even more painful than adjustment,'\\nobserves Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's long-serving finance minister. He is\\nsympathetic to their plight, but that is scant comfort.\\nEven in the most successful of the 30 or so countries in various stages of\\nstructural adjustment, relief is modest and the road ahead long and arduous.\\nAt present growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it\\nwould take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income\\ncountries. The less successful have longer to wait: 'With today's poor\\npolicies it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita\\nincome of the mid 70s', says a Bank official.\\nIn the meantime, Africa is being left far behind by countries which have\\nmade better use of their resources and compete more vigorously for capital.\\nIn 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is\\nthree times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than\\nGhana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.\\nEqually striking is Africa's declining share of developing-country exports\\nof food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17\\nto 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share.\\n'Can Africa's decline be reversed?' asked the Bank in its last important\\nstudy of the continent's plight: 'The simple answer is yes. It can be and it\\nmust be. The alternative is too ghastly to contemplate.'\\nFour years later, the region remains racked by disease, disaster and debt:\\nthe question becomes more compelling, the alternative creeps closer. The\\nBank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4\\nto 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well\\nbelow the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population.\\nToday, more people in Africa are poorer, and more children are dying. Other\\nsigns of stress are apparent, beginning with the distressing list of\\ncountries that have effectively ceased to function as modern nation states:\\nZaire, Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, Angola. Hopes raised by the end of the war\\nin Ethiopia, the peace agreement in Mozambique, and a fragile peace pact in\\nLiberia, are offset by renewed civil war in Angola and Nigeria's steady\\ndecline, and strife in Sierra Leone and Rwanda.\\nFormer 'success' stories and 'role models' in the 1970s have since become\\ncautionary tales. Kenya struggles to implement economic reforms which erode\\nthe patronage on which the ruling Kanu party has been so dependent. Cote\\nd'Ivoire moves deeper into difficulties that cannot be addressed until the\\nCFA franc is devalued, an obstacle that holds up effective economic reform\\nin the 13-member CFA bloc.\\nThe collapse of the settlement in Angola and continuing violence in South\\nAfrica raise doubts about whether, in the short term at least, southern\\nAfrica can be the engine-room for regional growth.\\nMost disturbing of all, perhaps, is the concern that Africa no longer has\\nthe adequate institutional capacity to help itself. The technological gap\\nbetween Africa and the world has widened, and the continent's management is\\nweak. Many schools and universities are without teaching materials. Civil\\nservices have been neglected or politicised. The integrity of the judiciary\\nhas been eroded.\\nMeanwhile, Aids takes its terrible toll. More than half of the world's 15m\\nsufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m Africans.\\nAn estimated 14m will be infected by 2000; many are from the skilled urban\\nclass on which the implementation of reform greatly depends.\\nHopes that the emergence of multi-party politics would prove a simple\\nstepping stone to good governance have proved premature. Opposition parties\\nhave turned out to be weak, fractious and susceptible to patronage, owing\\nmore to ethnicity than policy for their support.\\nFor the industrialised world, the will to help may emerge only when an\\nailing Africa is seen as a threat to self-interest, in the form of\\nimmigration to southern Europe, or a rise in Moslem extremism, growth in\\ndrug-trafficking or health risks posed by a continent that cannot be\\nring-fenced; or when it is stimulated by the loss of flora and fauna with\\nmedicinal value, or environmental concerns.\\nSelf-interest or humanitarian imperative, Unicef's poignant warning is\\ntimely: 'The abandonment of hopes for the continent would mean the writing\\noff of the talents, aspirations and potential of one eighth of mankind, both\\nnow and far into the next century.'\\nFrom Africa must come a new generation of leaders, committed to reform, and\\ntapping the same spirit that brought freedom 30 years ago. Angered by the\\nfailures of corrupt and autocratic leaders, frustrated by economic policies\\nthat did not deliver, impatient to recover their lost civil rights, and worn\\nout by wars, Africa's people are striving for a fresh start.\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nOctober 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMANY SAY THEY WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SWALLOW GAS TAX \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a Mobil service station in downtown Los Angeles, Michael Pracha leaned \\nagainst his black station wagon Tuesday and watched with resignation as the \\nelectronic digits tallied his gasoline bill with dizzying speed: $23, $24, $25. \\n\\n\\nFor Pracha, 36, who drives as many as 800 miles a week in his job as a garment \\nindustry production manager, there is nothing abstract about the proposed \\n12-cent-a-gallon tax hike that is part of the federal deficit-reduction \\npackage. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s bad,\" he said between bites of an ice cream sandwich. \"But again, there\\'s \\nnothing you can do. You still have to go to work, you have to travel and you \\nhave to pay the extra money.\" \\n\\n\\nThe proposed federal gasoline tax would come on the heels of a \\n27.1-cent-a-gallon increase that has raised the average price of regular \\nunleaded gasoline to $1.346 a gallon since the crisis in the Persian Gulf \\nbegan, according to the American Automobile Assn. In California, price \\nincreases have included a 5-cent-a-gallon voter-approved state tax hike that \\nwent into effect Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. \\n\\n\\nThe proposed federal tax would place a further burden on motorists, \\nparticularly low-income consumers, and squeeze service station operators, \\ncritics said. The tax, which would be phased in incrementally, has drawn fire \\nfrom consumer groups, service station organizations, petroleum marketers and \\nthe automobile association, which called it \"reckless public policy in the face \\nof a recession.\" \\n\\n\\nObservers say a new federal tax would cut demand for gasoline only slightly. \\nWithin a year, it would drop 1% to 1.5% from its current level of 7.7 million \\nbarrels a day, economists estimated. Still, at around 100,000 barrels a day, \\n\"that\\'s no small potatoes,\" said Gary N. Ross, president of Petroleum Industry \\nResearch Associates of New York. \\n\\n\\nSome motorists have already cut gasoline consumption and altered their driving \\nhabits. \"I\\'m driving less and making more use of my time when I\\'m on the road,\" \\nsaid Ed Rodieck, 25, an Orange businessman who drives 60 to 90 miles a day. \\n\"I\\'m starting to ride-share a lot more . . . (And when I\\'m in downtown Los \\nAngeles), I do a lot more walking . . . and take the DASH bus.\" \\n\\n\\nMotorists who can\\'t cut back stand to suffer the most, critics said. \\n\\n\\n\"I can\\'t ride-share with anybody,\" said Gerry Walling, a 43-year-old legal \\nlibrarian from Monrovia who drives 45 to 130 miles a day. \\n\\n\\n\"I have to have my own car because of my obligations to go to other offices,\" \\nshe said as she filled her tank at a Unocal station downtown. So far, she \\nadded, the price hike \"hasn\\'t affected my family (financially). But it may. I \\ndon\\'t know how it\\'s going to affect us if it keeps going up.\" \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a regressive tax,\" said Nicholas Fedoruk of the consumer group Citizen \\nAction in Washington. \"It has the largest impact on the low- and middle-income \\nconsumers.\" \\n\\n\\nMotorists would not be the only ones to suffer. The tax could add to service \\nstation owners\\' costs of processing credit card transactions, cut sales volumes \\nand increase cash flow requirements, industry officials said. \\n\\n\\nRobert Weiss, who owns Bob\\'s Chevron in Anaheim, said the price run-ups in the \\npast two months have turned motorists away. His sales volumes have fallen by \\n15%, he said. \\n\\n\\nAlthough prices are higher, he says his per-gallon gross profit margin, out of \\nwhich he pays rent and overhead, has actually shrunk. \"The lower our volumes \\ngo, the more rent we pay\" to Chevron, he added. Higher taxes will drive away \\neven more customers, he said. \\n\\n\\nAlthough Weiss said he has not suffered serious financial problems, others \\nmight not be so lucky. The tax \"affects the marginal dealer,\" said Stephen \\nShelton, executive director of the Southern California Service Station Assn. in \\nIrvine. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJuly 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nU.S. AUTO MAKERS SPLIT ON GAS TAX HIKE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Big Three domestic auto makers are divided over the idea of raising the \\nfederal gasoline tax to help reduce the budget deficit, unusual in an industry \\nthat often puts unity ahead of competition in lobbying Congress. \\n\\n\\nFord Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. favor boosting the 9-cent-per-gallon federal \\nlevy on gasoline by a nickel a year for three to five years. Every penny \\nincrease would raise about $1 billion. \\n\\n\\nBut General Motors Corp., the nation\\'s largest automobile manufacturer, opposes \\nany increase in gasoline taxes. \\n\\n\\n\"We have constantly said, and I think Congress has said, that the gasoline tax \\nis too regressive, that it hurts the poor people,\" GM Chairman Roger B. Smith \\nsaid. He discussed the issue with lawmakers during a visit to Washington last \\nweek. \\n\\n\\nChrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca is an outspoken supporter of higher gas taxes, \\nwhich he says would encourage people to drive more fuel-efficient cars. In the \\n1980s, Chrysler\\'s marketing strategy emphasized more fuel-efficient vehicles. \\n\\n\\nIacocca said the higher taxes would boost conservation, lower the nation\\'s \\ntrade deficit and help counter global warming by curbing emissions. \\n\\n\\n\"Consumers must demand more fuel-efficient vehicles, and today they have no \\nreason to do that,\" Iacocca said. The cost of driving has been cut in half \\nsince the 1960s when adjusted for inflation and improved fuel efficiency, he \\nclaimed. \\n\\n\\nFord would accept a gradual increase in the gasoline tax as part of a package \\nof consumption taxes, company spokesman Mark Miller said. \"But we believe it \\nshould go toward reducing the deficit and not toward increasing government \\nspending,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nThe gasoline tax frequently is mentioned as a potential source of new revenue \\nas the White House and congressional leaders negotiate a deficit-reduction \\nplan. \\n\\n\\nPresident Bush has indicated a willingness to abandon his no-new-taxes pledge. \\nSenate Republican leader Bob Dole said this week that he expects Bush to reject \\nincome tax increases in favor of other sources. A White House spokeswoman said, \\nhowever, that the President had ruled out nothing. \\n\\n\\nAt the heart of the Big Three domestic auto makers\\' disagreement is how a gas \\ntax increase would affect auto sales. \\n\\n\\nGM contends that many people would delay new-car purchases. The company has \\npredicted that a 15-cents-per-gallon increase would reduce sales by 500,000 and \\neliminate 120,000 jobs. \\n\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think the country wants to see lower car sales,\" Smith of GM said. \\n\\n\\nChrysler agrees that a higher tax might hurt sales, \"but not significantly,\" \\nspokesman John Guiniven said. \"We also feel that reducing the budget deficit \\nwould reduce interest rates and that could spur car sales and the entire \\neconomy.\" \\n\\n\\nSmith agreed that the federal Treasury needs new revenue but said Congress \\nshould focus on taxes that would affect a broader segment of the economy. \\n\\n\\nThe Big Three are a powerful force on Capitol Hill. They usually reach common \\npositions on legislative issues with a major impact on their industry, such as \\nthe Clean Air Act rewrite. \\n\\n\\nSometimes, however, consensus eludes them. \\n\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t the norm, but it does happen,\" said Tim McCarthy, lobbyist for the \\nMotor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn., which represents the Big Three, Honda, Volvo \\nand some truck companies. \"We spend a lot of time trying to reach a consensus. \\nIt\\'s a competitive industry, with differences of opinion.\" \\n\\n\\nMcCarthy said it was too early to tell whether the auto makers would clash if \\nthe budget summit produced an agreement to seek a gasoline tax increase. \\n\\n\\nAuto makers are more concerned with the impending clean-air negotiations and a \\nbill awaiting Senate debate that would boost the minimum average fuel-economy \\nrequirement for new-car fleets to about 40 miles per gallon from 27.5, he said. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': \"\\n\\n\\n\\nF. Gas Guzzler Tax Applicability to Alternative-Fueled Vehicles \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStatement of Proposal \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Alternative Motor Fuels Act did not address the \\n\\napplicability of the so-called ``gas guzzler tax'' to dedicated or \\n\\ndual alternative-fueled vehicles. The Energy Tax Act of 1978, 26 \\n\\nU.S.C. 4064, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury (after \\n\\nconsultation with the Secretary of Transportation) to include in \\n\\nthe gas guzzler tax program automobiles fueled with any product \\n\\nof petroleum or natural gas if such inclusion is consistent with \\n\\nthe need of the nation to conserve energy. While alternative \\n\\nfuels thus could be included in the gas guzzler tax program, the \\n\\nSecretary of Treasury has not included such fuels by regulation \\n\\nunder this section to date, and dedicated alternative-fueled \\n\\nautomobiles thus do not appear to be currently subject to the gas \\n\\nguzzler tax. However, since dual-fueled automobiles can operate \\n\\non gasoline, the applicability of the gas guzzler tax under \\n\\ncurrent law is less clear. The EPA solicited comments regarding \\n\\nwhether alternative-fueled automobiles or dual-fueled automobiles \\n\\nshould be included in the gas guzzler tax program, but did not \\n\\nmake any proposals in the NPRM. These comments were submitted to \\n\\nthe Internal Revenue Service for their consideration. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummary of Comments \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral automobile manufacturers provided comments \\n\\nrecommending that dedicated and dual alternative-fueled vehicles \\n\\nnot be included in the gas guzzler tax program. These \\n\\nmanufacturers stated that the purpose of the AMFA is to \\n\\nfacilitate widespread use of alternative fuels through incentives \\n\\nand that subjecting these vehicles to the gas guzzler tax program \\n\\nwould contravene the goals of the AMFA. The Senate bill \\n\\noriginally included a section intended to ``clarify that the lower \\n\\nenergy content of the alternative fuels covered by this bill do \\n\\nnot trigger the so-called 'gas-guzzler' tax provisions of current \\n\\nlaw.'' However, this section was deleted since taxes are revenue \\n\\nrelated matters that most appropriately should originate in the \\n\\nHouse of Representatives. Senator Rockefeller stated in the \\n\\nCongressional Record&hyph;Senate of April 15, 1988, page S. 4101: \\n\\n``in deleting section 8 from S.1518 that we believe the \\n\\ninterpretation of the law should remain exactly as it was with \\n\\nsection 8 in the bill.'' \\n\\n\\nARCO recommended that any motor fuel tax be applied equally \\n\\nto all motor fuels including alternative fuels to preserve the \\n\\nenergy conservation intent of the Energy Tax Act of 1978. ARCO \\n\\nsuggested that dual-fueled vehicles be subject to the gas guzzler \\n\\ntax based on the fuel economy when operated on gasoline. This \\n\\nwill appropriately tax vehicles that are designed to run on the \\n\\nalternative fuel but will most likely operate inefficiently on \\n\\ngasoline. The generation of CAFE credits provided by the AMFA \\n\\nwould likely result in the production of gas-guzzling vehicles. \\n\\nARCO provided an example that showed that a M85 dual-fueled \\n\\nvehicle which has an mpg rating of 20 while operating on gasoline \\n\\nand 16 while operating on M85 would have a calculated fuel \\n\\neconomy under the CAFE credit provisions of the AMFA of 34 mpg. \\n\\nThey state for this example, at 34 mpg, that the dual-fueled \\n\\nvehicle would not be taxed as a gas guzzler. However, at 20 mpg \\n\\ngasoline fuel economy, ARCO feels that the tax would be \\n\\njustifiable and consistent with the intent of the Energy Tax Act \\n\\nto conserve energy. \\n\\n\\nNESEA stated that because of the positive attributes of \\n\\nalternative-fueled vehicles and the urgency of switching away \\n\\nfrom oil-fueled cars, alternative-fueled and dual-fueled vehicles \\n\\nshould be included in the gas guzzler tax program as this is an \\n\\nexcellent first step in acknowledging the real costs of running \\n\\ngasoline powered vehicles. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEPA Position \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe EPA does not have the authority to decide which vehicles \\n\\nand fuels are subject to the gas guzzler tax program. This \\n\\nauthority lies with the Department of Treasury. The IRS agreed \\n\\nthat EPA's decision to label dual-fueled automobiles for gas \\n\\nguzzler tax purposes based on the fuel economy while operating on \\n\\ngasoline is in accordance with the law. Therefore, EPA will \\n\\nlabel dual-fueled vehicles using the current regulations for \\n\\ngasoline-fueled vehicles contained in 40 CFR part 600, §600.513. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV. Technical Amendments \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo save the time and printing costs involved in publishing \\n\\nthem under a separate notice, the following technical amendments \\n\\nto the 40 CFR parts 86 and 600 are included in this final rule. \\n\\nTechnical amendments described under items A and B below were \\n\\nproposed in the NPRM. EPA received no comments on these \\n\\namendments and therefore will be included in the final rule as \\n\\nproposed. Technical amendments described under items C, D, and \\n\\nE, were not included in the NPRM. By issuing these technical \\n\\namendments directly as a final rule, EPA is foregoing the \\n\\nissuance of an NPRM and the opportunity for public comment on the \\n\\nproposal provided by the NPRM rulemaking process. Such a \\n\\ncurtailed procedure is permitted by 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and section \\n\\n307(d) of the Clean Air Act when issuance of a proposal and \\n\\npublic comments would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary \\n\\nto the public interest. The Agency is publishing this action \\n\\nwithout prior proposal because these are non-controversial \\n\\ncorrections that rectify minor errors and omissions in the Part \\n\\n600 regulations in a manner that does not substantively change \\n\\nthe requirements of the final rule. The Agency finds that this \\n\\nconstitutes good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) for a determination \\n\\nthat the issuance of an NPRM is unnecessary. \\n\\n\\nA. A formaldehyde concentration term is being added to the \\n\\ndilution factor equation located in 40 CFR 86.144&hyph;90(c)(7)(ii) \\n\\nand 86.144&hyph;94(c)(7)(ii). Although the magnitude of the \\n\\nformaldehyde concentration is very low, it is possible that an \\n\\nassumption of zero concentration could lead to a slight change in \\n\\ncalculated fuel economy. There is no reason why the formaldehyde \\n\\nconcentration term should be left out of the equation. With this \\n\\namendment, all measured carbon-containing compounds will be \\n\\nincluded in the dilution factor equation. \\n\\n\\nB. The symbol ``x'' is struck from the dilution factor equation \\n\\non 40 CFR 86.144&hyph;90(c)(7)(ii) and 86.144&hyph;94(c)(7)(ii) the first \\n\\ntime it appears in the equation. The first time ``x'' appears in \\n\\nthe equation, it is used to represent multiplication. All other \\n\\noccurrences of ``x'' in the equation represent the measured fuel \\n\\ncomposition parameter: C\\n\\n\\nx\\n\\n\\nH\\n\\n\\ny\\n\\n\\nO\\n\\n\\nz\\n\\n\\n. By dropping the first occurrence of \\n\\n``x'', only the latter meaning is retained. The multiplication \\n\\nfunction can be assumed by virtue of a number adjacent to a \\n\\nvariable enclosed in parenthesis. \\n\\n\\nC. Part 600.513&hyph;91 (b)(2)(xii) currently reads ``(xii) At least \\n\\n12.5 mpg, the gas guzzler tax statement shall show a tax of \\n\\n$7,700''. This has been mis-typed; ``At least'' should read ``Less \\n\\nthan''. Therefore, the statement is amended to read: ``Less than \\n\\n12.5 mpg, the gas guzzler tax statement shall show a tax of \\n\\n$7,700''. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nNovember 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWILL STATIONS HAVE TO \\'EAT\\' THE NEW GAS TAX? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA new nickel-a-gallon federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel goes into effect \\nSaturday, but it\\'s unclear how much of that increase will find its way to the \\ncorner gasoline station. \\n\\n\\nOn one hand, service station operators say they can\\'t afford to swallow any of \\nthe tax and must pass the 5-cent hike onto consumers. On the other hand, \\nservice station operators may not want to risk losing any more customers, \\nespecially since demand for gasoline has already fallen dramatically in the \\nface of high prices resulting from the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, \\nanalysts note. \\n\\n\\n\"You\\'re damned if you do and damned if you don\\'t,\" said David Carney, who \\noperates Hillside Chevron in Torrance. \\n\\n\\nThe 5-cent tax was approved by Congress in October as part of the budget \\nreconciliation act, with half of the anticipated $5 billion in new revenues \\ngoing to reduce the federal budget deficit and half to finance transportation \\nprojects. It boosts total federal gasoline taxes to 14 cents a gallon. \\n\\n\\nScott Jones, an industry analyst and president of AUS Consultants Inc. in \\nPhiladelphia, said his firm\\'s research indicates most retailers will hike \\nprices the full nickel at first, but then back off in the next two or three \\nweeks, with dealers ultimately eating two cents of the increase. \\n\\n\\n\"Picture four service stations at an intersection,\" Jones said. \"Given the \\ncurrent market situation, with sellers of gasoline vying for decreasing demand, \\nit will be too enticing for one of those four stations to raise their prices \\nonly four cents a gallon while the other three raise theirs a whole nickel. \\nThen it starts.\" \\n\\n\\nThere is another scenario: refiners or oil companies could decide to drop the \\nwholesale prices of gasoline sold to dealers to offset the tax hike. \\n\\n\\n\"There\\'s a possibility that retailers will appeal to branded refiners and say, \\n\\'Look, the competition is forcing us to lower our prices; you guys have to give \\nus some help,\\' \" Jones said. But, he added, \"Normally this sort of thing falls \\nfull force on the retailer.\" \\n\\n\\nNone of seven major oil company spokesmen interviewed Thursday would comment on \\nfuture price changes, saying only that the companies would remain competitive. \\n\\n\\nChevron Corp., however, recently dropped posted wholesale prices of gasoline 4 \\ncents a gallon in California. But there was no net effect on wholesale prices, \\nbecause the change simply reflected a discount already being offered to \\ndealers. \\n\\n\\nTexaco Inc. said it has dropped Los Angeles wholesale prices of its regular \\nunleaded gasoline 5 cents a gallon and diesel fuel 6 cents a gallon in the last \\ntwo weeks. \\n\\n\\nJerry Kaplan, a Shell dealer in Sherman Oaks, said he believes Shell Oil Co. \\nmay drop its wholesale gasoline prices 2 cents a gallon, though a Shell \\nspokesman would not comment on that. \\n\\n\\nBut whatever Shell does, Kaplan said, consumer wrath would still fall on him. \\n\"We collect every kind of tax you can think of, and my customer looks at me and \\nsays, \\'You ought to get your hand slapped for what you\\'re doing,\\' \" he said. \"I \\nthink it\\'s totally unfair.\" \\n\\n\\nIn addition to the 5-cent hike on Saturday, federal taxes will rise another 0.1 \\ncent per gallon to raise money for a fund to deal with leaking underground \\nstorage tanks. \\n\\n\\nFor Californians, the tax increases follow a state hike of 5 cents a gallon on \\nAug. 1 -- the day before the invasion -- and precedes another penny-a-gallon \\nstate tax hike coming Jan. 1. By then, the price of a gallon of gasoline will \\ninclude 38 cents in taxes. \\n\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the taxes are paid by wholesalers of gasoline and built \\ninto the cost of the fuel sold to retailers: service stations, bulk \\ndistributors and others. \\n\\n\\nWhether they pass that cost onto consumers depends on a variety of factors. \\n\\n\\nAlready, retail prices of gasoline have skyrocketed about 30 cents a gallon \\nsince the Iraqi invasion, although they have stabilized in the last five weeks \\nor so. This week, the national average price of a gallon of regular, self-serve \\nunleaded gasoline -- the most popular grade -- was $1.366 a gallon, according \\nto the American Automobile Assn. \\n\\n\\nUntil recently, the run-up in retail prices had not kept up with the rise in \\nthe cost of crude oil, from which gasoline is made, or in some cases with the \\nwholesale cost of gasoline sold to dealers. That meant that many dealers were \\nseeing their operating margins squeezed at the same time demand fell off. \\n\\n\\nOperating margins for retailers nationally fell from 13.9 cents a gallon on \\nJuly 6 to 8 cents a gallon on Aug. 24, according to the widely read Lundberg \\nSurvey. That margin has recovered to about 13.4 cents a gallon now, Lundberg \\nreported. Out of that margin, dealers must pay overhead, income taxes and other \\nexpenses before seeing a profit. \\n\\n\\nLou Bacca, who operates Chevron stations in Costa Mesa and Santa Ana, said his \\nsales volume has fallen about 15% and his profits are down 25% since the \\ninvasion. \"I\\'m going to do my best to pass (the new tax) on, because our \\nprofits are pretty slim right now,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nBut there are real concerns that another steep hike in gas prices will further \\ndiscourage motorists from buying. \\n\\n\\nCarney said sales volume at his Chevron station in Torrance fell 30% from Aug. \\n1 to Aug. 4 -- first, because of the new 5-cent-a-gallon state sales tax, then \\nbecause of a 5-cent-a-gallon price increase due to the Iraqi invasion. Sales \\nhave not yet bounced back, Carney said. \\n\\n\\nNationwide, gasoline demand was 2.7% lower in October than a year before. \\n\\n\\nGAS PRICES \\n\\n\\nImmediately after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the American Automobile Assn. \\nbegan reporting national gasoline prices daily. After the first few weeks, it \\nbegan reporting prices weekly. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

But whether they liked it or not, all the \\nmotorists queued up at service stations across Southern California on Saturday \\nbegan paying the new federal excise tax, which added 5 cents to every gallon of \\ngas sold. \\n\\n\\n\"The government already takes out so much in taxes,\" said Tiffany Lee, 22, a \\nmodel, who filled her Hyundai Sonata at an Arco Station in Los Angeles\\' \\nKoreatown. \"It doesn\\'t seem fair that they\\'re going after more tax money.

Several people \\nfilling their tanks at a Shell station in mid-town Ventura said they could \\nenvision gas prices going to $2 a gallon. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll just keep driving,\" said Nigel Thornell, 46, a medical lab specialist \\nfrom Santa Barbara. \"There isn\\'t much choice.\" \\n\\n\\nFernando Gamua, manager of Seaward Mobil in Ventura, said people initially were \\nannoyed by a nickel-a-gallon state tax increase in August and since have \\naccepted the escalating costs. \\n\\n\\nStill, motorists lined up Friday night at Argett Chevron in Ventura to fill up \\ntheir tanks before the price hike took effect at midnight, said Josh Nudd, a \\nstation attendant. \\n\\n\\nOn Saturday, \"Some people were kind of upset and wished they\\'d come in last \\nnight,\" Nudd said. \\n\\n\\nPedra Salcedo, a housekeeper in Santa Ana who commutes every day from jobs in \\nNewport Beach and Corona del Mar, said she fills up her small pickup twice a \\nweek, spending from $20 to $25. \\n\\n\\n\"One day it\\'s $10; another day it takes $12,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nIn Chatsworth, Kim Oswald, 28, said she went to five gas stations looking for \\nthe lowest price before stopping at an Arco station. The price for regular \\nleaded gas: $1.27. \\n\\n\\n\"Some of us are barely making it as it is,\" Oswald said as she filled up a \\nwell-worn Pontiac Bonneville. \\n\\n\\nMore than the extra 5 cents per gallon, motorists seemed to be dismayed at \\nhaving no say over Congress\\' action to increase taxes in its budget agreement. \\nSome were upset that President Bush has not been held accountable to his \\ncampaign promises of no new taxes. \\n\\n\\n\"Everything he promised he was going to do, he hasn\\'t followed through on,\" \\nsaid the Pasadena bond broker. \"I\\'m not happy with him at all.

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nJuly 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n FILL \\'ER UP -- GAS PRICES RISE 5 WEDNESDAY; \\n\\n\\nTRANSPORTATION: THE VOTER-APPROVED TAX HIKE WILL PAY FOR STATE HIGHWAY \\nPROJECTS. ONE-CENT INCREASES WILL FOLLOW IN EACH OF THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia\\'s gasoline price, a slave in recent years to fluctuations in crude \\noil markets and bottlenecks at the nation\\'s refineries, on Wednesday is going a \\nnickel-a-gallon higher. \\n\\n\\nBut this time neither flighty markets nor overburdened refineries will shoulder \\nthe blame. We did it to ourselves. \\n\\n\\nThe increase comes from a voter decision June 5 to approve Proposition 111, a \\nballot measure that triggered a 9-cent-per-gallon hike in gasoline taxes. Five \\ncents of that increase will go into effect Wednesday. The rest of the increase \\nwill be phased in over the next four years with 1-cent tax hikes becoming \\neffective every Jan. 1. \\n\\n\\nTo those who harbor hopes that petroleum retailers or wholesalers will soften \\nthe financial blow by absorbing some or all of the increase, the answer from \\ngasoline dealers is emphatic. \\n\\n\\n\"No way,\" said John DeWitt, owner of J. E. DeWitt Inc., a gasoline wholesaler \\nin South El Monte who also owns some retail stations. \"The delivery costs from \\nthe refinery to the station, trucking costs and overhead, so many government \\nrules, regulations and fees make that impossible.\" \\n\\n\\nJim Gigoux, executive director of the California Independent Oil Marketers \\nAssn., said a few stations may introduce the tax hike gradually but \"you can \\nbet in a very short time everybody\\'s going to be up 5 cents a gallon.\" \\n\\n\\nSo on Wednesday most California motorists will see new prices at their corner \\ngas stations. Where the night before self-serve unleaded gas may have sold for \\n$1.08 a gallon, or regular for a bargain 99 cents a gallon, prices will be \\n$1.13 for unleaded and $1.04 for regular. \\n\\n\\n\"You tell me one other industry that has it prices out there in three-foot-high \\nletters on the street,\" complained Gigoux. \"People complain about $1 a gallon \\nfor gasoline but they think nothing of going into the grocery and spending a \\nlot more than that for water in a fancy bottle.\" \\n\\n\\nThe tax hike was designed by the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian to help \\nfinance a 10-year, $18.5-billion transportation program that they hope will \\nease traffic congestion, repair crumbling highways and bridges and provide \\nbetter access to rail transit. \\n\\n\\nFor consumers, it means the total federal and state taxes paid on a gallon of \\ngasoline in California will be about 30 cents. \\n\\n\\nIt works out this way: Customers already pay a 9-cent federal tax and a 9-cent \\nstate tax. Then there will be the extra nickel as of Wednesday. But California \\nmotorists actually pay a tax on a tax in the form of a sales tax, ranging from \\n6 1/4% to 7 1/4% depending on the area of the state, that is added on top of \\nthe state and federal gas taxes. \\n\\n\\nSo in addition to the $5.3 billion in new revenue the state expects to garner \\nfrom the gas tax hike in the next five years, it will also collect $220 million \\nfrom its share of the sales tax that is levied on that tax. \\n\\n\\nWhile the new tax is expected to produce some grumbling from customers, Gigoux \\nsaid the real complaints are coming from gasoline distributors who must forward \\nthe tax to the State Board of Equalization, the agency responsible for \\ncollecting it. \\n\\n\\nHe said the new tax contributes to cash flow concerns because distributors pay \\nthe tax before they deliver gasoline, but they may not be paid by the \\ncommercial account that receives the delivery for another 10 to 30 days. An \\nadditional tax, he said, means that much more they have to carry until payment \\nis made. \\n\\n\\n\"It is an additional strain on an already strained cash flow,\" said DeWitt. \\n\"The industry is already operating with a lot of trusses and unfortunately when \\nyou get another injury, sometimes there aren\\'t enough trusses to hold it in.\" \\n\\n\\nBut neither DeWitt nor Gigoux expect the tax hike to have any effect on the \\nhabits of the buying public. \"Mom is still going to go play bridge, pop\\'s going \\nto take the kid to Little League and he\\'s still going to go to his Saturday \\ngolf game,\" said Gigoux. \\n\\n\\nBy now, both say, California customers are accustomed to price changes prompted \\nby the rise and fall of crude oil costs and a shortage of refinery capacity \\nthat often makes the petroleum processing plants unable to keep pace with \\ndemand. While prices have fluctuated over the last few years, American \\nAutomobile Assn. surveys show a slight rise in California since Memorial Day. \\n\\n\\nAt the Board of Equalization, officials do not expect any major problems to \\ndevelop with collections as the new tax increase goes into effect. \\n\\n\\n\"Based on our past experience, we expect it all to go smoothly,\" said Delena \\nBratton, tax service specialist for the board. \\n\\n\\nThe last time the state increased the gas tax was in 1983 when it went up 2 \\ncents, from 7 to 9 cents a gallon. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFEW FUME OVER NEW 5-CENT GAS TAX \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalifornia\\'s new gasoline tax went into effect Wednesday with few apparent \\nhitches, drawing resigned grumbles from motorists as nearly 12,000 service \\nstations across the state began collecting an extra nickel for each gallon of \\ngas they sell. \\n\\n\\nSpot reports from service stations and dealer associations throughout Southern \\nCalifornia and the rest of the state indicated that most motorists came \\nprepared to pay more for gas when they pulled up to the pumps throughout the \\nday Wednesday. \\n\\n\\nProposition 111 -- a ballot initiative designed to use a 9-cent gas tax hike to \\nease traffic jams, repair worn freeways and bridges and pay for more public \\ntransportation -- was approved by 52% of the state\\'s voters in June. After \\nWednesday\\'s tax hike, a 1-cent increase will be added to the five-cent tax each \\nyear until 1995. \\n\\n\\nThere were scattered accounts of panic buying in the last hours before the tax \\nwent into effect at midnight Wednesday morning and reports that some dealers \\nraised prices even higher than the 5-cent increase. And a few Los Angeles \\nservice stations angered motorists by raising prices two hours before the \\ndeadline fell. \\n\\n\\nBut at most service stations, drivers simply came up with the extra change -- \\nwhether they liked it or not. \\n\\n\\n\"As far as we\\'ve heard, it was met by a well-prepped public,\" said Stephen R. \\nShelton, executive director of the Southern California Service Station Assn., \\nwhich represents 1,900 stations. \"People voted for it -- they should expect \\nit.\" \\n\\n\\nYet despite repeated public warnings about the impending tax in recent weeks, \\nthere were some who arrived blissfully ignorant of the new prices. Mike Murphy, \\na 19-year-old college student who drove up to a Santa Barbara gas station to \\nfill up his Toyota station wagon for a day of surfing, was startled by the \\nnews. \\n\\n\\n\"What tax?\" he asked. Told that California voters had voted in favor of the \\nmeasure to pay for transportation improvements, Murphy was still befuddled: \\n\"What vote?\" \\n\\n\\nFinally, a more detailed explanation was provided. \"You mean the tax started \\nthis morning?\" he asked. \"Bummer. . . . I should have filled up last night.\" \\n\\n\\nMany did, saving a few cents a gallon for a few minutes spent in gas lines \\nreminiscent of those that lasted for hours during the oil crisis of 1973. In \\nVentura County, station owners and managers said business at their pumps \\nincreased more than 20% on Monday and Tuesday as people tried to get in their \\nlast tank of gas before the price change. \\n\\n\\nGabriel Cortez, manager of a Union 76 station near the Los Angeles Country \\nClub, said that drivers lined up to save money on gas Tuesday night. \"We sold \\n8,000 gallons of gas,\" he said. \"That\\'s 500 more gallons than usual.\" \\n\\n\\nTwo hours before the deadline, drivers filling up at a Unocal station on \\nSherman Way in Van Nuys complained to Los Angeles police that they were forced \\nto pay the nickel tax before it had officially started. \\n\\n\\nA manager who represents independent Unocal dealers in the Los Angeles area \\nconfirmed that many Unocal stations -- including the Van Nuys station -- raised \\nprices early. The manager, who declined to give his name, said the stations had \\nonly two employees on duty after 10 p.m. and would have had difficulty changing \\nprices on meters while motorists waited to pay for their gas. \\n\\n\\nService station association officials said they hoped that most of their \\nmembers would not try to take advantage of the tax increase. But they \\nacknowledged that some might. \\n\\n\\nIn the Northern California town of Redding, near the Oregon line, one gas \\nstation owner, Bill Swigart, said he had no choice but tack an extra cent a \\ngallon onto the 5-cent tax. \\n\\n\\n\"If I just go up five cents, I get hurt,\" he said, explaining that he would \\nonly break even if he raised his price by a slightly higher fraction of a cent. \\nTo round the price off, he added the full extra cent. \"My rep said it would \\nhurt me, but my customers aren\\'t balking,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nCloser to the Oregon line, industry officials worried that service station \\nowners in towns such as Yreka and Henley might lose business because of the tax \\nhike. \\n\\n\\n\"If their customers can go over the state line and get cheaper gas, this could \\nend up hurting them bad,\" Shelton said. \\n\\n\\nOne San Francisco Bay Area gasoline distribution company executive said she was \\nbracing for a motorist backlash. \"I just hope that the consumers understand \\nwhat\\'s going on here,\" said Bonnie Addario, senior vice president of Olympia \\nOil Co. \"They voted for it, but they\\'ll be the first ones to complain about \\nit.\" \\n\\n\\nAlso contributing to this story were Times staff writers Phillip Gollner, Josh \\nMeyer, Ronald Smith and Ben Sullivan in Los Angeles, Lisa Mascaro and \\nCherylanne Bealer in Orange County, Kirsten Lee Swartz in Ventura, Bonna M. de \\nla Cruz in San Diego, Miles Corwin in Santa Barbara and Harold Maas in San \\nFrancisco. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

            "{'text': '\\n\\n\\nAugust 2, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPUMPS SLOWER ON FIRST DAY OF 5-CENT-A-GALLON HIKE IN GAS TAX; \\n\\n\\nECONOMY: MANY CUSTOMERS FILLED THEIR TANKS THE DAY BEFORE, BUT SOME ARE \\nGRUMBLING ABOUT THE VOTER-APPROVED INCREASE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSan Diego gasoline dealers said business appeared slower than usual Wednesday, \\nthe first day of a statewide 5-cent-a-gallon tax increase, as motorists \\ngrumbled and shook their heads over paying an extra nickel. \\n\\n\\n\"Overall, it seems as if prices are drifting up anyway. There\\'s been this \\ngradual increase in prices, and now that\\'s being compounded by this tax \\nincrease,\" said Bill Bleha of Carlsbad, who was filling up his tank Wednesday \\nat an Encinitas service station. \\n\\n\\nMark Ratoner, owner of a Shell station conveniently located off an Interstate 5 \\nramp in Chula Vista, said his usually thriving business, teeming with tourists \\nheaded to Mexico, was lagging Wednesday. \\n\\n\\n\"Lots of people took advantage of the prices on Tuesday. Even if they didn\\'t \\nneed the gas, they filled up their tanks,\" he said. \"Business is slow now, but \\nthat\\'s only temporary. They have to come back and fill up eventually.\" \\n\\n\\nRatoner said Wednesday\\'s price increase is the largest one-time increase in gas \\nprices he can remember since the 1979 oil crisis. \"My customers usually don\\'t \\nmind if prices fluctuate a few pennies up or down, but this 5-cent increase is \\npretty hefty,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nThe nickel increase in California\\'s gas tax went into effect midnight Tuesday, \\nand a penny will be added each Jan. 1 for the next four years. Proceeds have \\nbeen earmarked for the state\\'s transportation program to repair highways and \\nbridges, ease traffic congestion and pour more funds into commuter rail \\ntransit. \\n\\n\\n\"Our prices are so high here in San Diego anyway, it really doesn\\'t matter \\nanymore,\" Bleha said. \"Whenever I go to L.A., I always make sure I fill up \\nthere.\" \\n\\n\\nFor the last few months, San Diego drivers have been paying higher gas prices \\non average than motorists in Los Angeles and other parts of the country, \\nsometimes as much as 10 cents more a gallon. Now, that gap is closing to about \\n4 cents, industry analysts say. \\n\\n\\nStill, bargain hunters who shop around in San Diego will have a harder time \\nfinding good deals at the gas pump. ARCO stations around the county, which \\nbefore Wednesday charged a thrifty 99 cents per gallon for regular gas, bumped \\nthat price up to $1.05, still stiff competition for other service stations \\ncharging as much as $1.17. \\n\\n\\n\"We were extra busy yesterday (Tuesday) because we let our regular customers \\nknow about the increase. Lots of people came rushing in today to try to beat \\nthe prices, but it was too late for them,\" said Letty Sanchez, a clerk at a \\ndowntown ARCO station. \\n\\n\\n\"Some people were shocked, but they know they have to buy gas,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nVincent and Teri Campanaro, a Phoenix couple vacationing in San Diego, said \\nthey were surprised at the high gas prices they found in the area. \"We pay \\n$1.10 for a gallon in Arizona,\" Vincent said, as he pumped regular unleaded gas \\ncosting $1.23 per gallon into his tank. \"That\\'s a big jump,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nSam Cardenas, a traveling industrial sales representative who said he fills up \\nat least twice a week and spends about $120 a month on gasoline, said he voted \\nagainst the tax increase last June. \"They should find the money elsewhere and \\ncut the waste out of the bureaucracy before asking us for more money,\" he said. \\n\\n\\n\"Every time taxes are raised for what they say will be road improvements, it \\nnever gets done,\" Cardenas said. \"I expect our gas prices to do nothing but \\nkeep going up.\" \\n\\n\\nCardenas and other motorists are concerned that gas prices will continue to \\nclimb, especially since OPEC\\'s announcement last week of an agreement to raise \\nprices, which could mean another dime-per-gallon increase. \\n\\n\\nMotorists ticked off about dishing out an extra nickel-per-gallon Wednesday \\nsaid they knew the increase was approved but did not expect to see prices at \\nthe pump go up so soon. \\n\\n\\n\"I knew it was coming, but I didn\\'t realize it was today until I heard it on \\nthe radio,\" said Maddie Townley, a Golden Hill resident and regular customer at \\na downtown Shell station. \\n\\n\\n\"I just hope the tax money goes to the road because we sure need it,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nCarolee Ferguson of Escondido, who was filling her tank at an Encinitas Texaco \\nstation, said she doesn\\'t like paying higher prices but thinks the trade-off is \\nworth it. \"They\\'re asking for the money to improve roads and relieve congested \\nareas. Since we are the ones who use the roads, we should pay for it,\" Ferguson \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\nMost San Diego service stations tacked an extra 6 cents, not 5 cents, to their \\nTuesday prices. \"We\\'re having to add more than 5 cents to cover the federal oil \\nspill liability surcharge and other taxes,\" said Judy Eppler, owner of a La \\nMesa Chevron station. \"We would have lost one-third of a cent for every gallon \\nwe sold if we hadn\\'t gone up that extra penny,\" she said. \\n\\n\\n\"Some customers out there have a feeling that the dealer is out to gouge them, \\nbut we\\'re at the bottom of the pecking order. We\\'re forced to pass on our extra \\ncosts to them,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nEppler, who has owned the station for two years, said she didn\\'t make her price \\nchange until mid-morning. \"Once I switched the numbers on the sign outside, \\nbusiness slowed down,\" she said. \\n\\n\\nCaltrans spokesman Jim Larson said the tax will enable the state to invest in a \\nhigh-level transportation program. \"People need to realize that the increase is \\nfor improvements to benefit everybody and to keep mobility on our freeways \\nhigh,\" he said. \\n\\n\\nProposition 111 was approved by voters last June, and the statewide gas tax \\nshould raise $15.5 billion for the state\\'s transportation department over the \\nnext 10 years, according to Lisa Covington in Caltrans\\' Sacramento office. \\n\\n\\nSan Diego County should receive $518 million over the next seven years in \\nhighway and transportation money, said Bill Tuomi, manager of the \\ntransportation program with the San Diego Assn. of Governments. \\n\\n\\nThat money will be used for construction of a $180-million interchange at I-5 \\nand the proposed California 56 in North County, as well as to buy a \\n$110-million tract along 40th Street in University Heights to complete a leg of \\nInterstate 15. \\n\\n\\nOther local uses of the gas tax increase include: \\n\\n\\n* $22 million as the state\\'s share in creating a four-lane freeway on \\nCalifornia 76, between I-5 and El Camino Real. \\n\\n\\n* $21 million to widen and fix California 78, from a portion in Vista to San \\nMarcos. \\n\\n\\n* $22.6 million to widen bridges, put in median barriers and build \\npark-and-ride lots on I-5, I-15 and California 163. \\n\\n\\n* $11.7 million to upgrade six lanes on I-15, from Oceanview Boulevard to \\nCalifornia 94. \\n\\n\\n* $20 million to build truck lanes on various freeways. \\n\\n\\n* $17 million to build a traffic operations center and additional freeway ramp \\nmetering. \\n\\n\\n* $230 million to be shared by the 18 cities in the county for local street and \\nroad improvements over the next 10 years. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

MOTORISTS BLAME BIG OIL FOR 10-CENT AVERAGE RISE IN GAS PRICES \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt a congressional hearing in Washington on Tuesday, a Nevada senator said the \\nAmerican public is \"mad as hell\" at sharply rising gasoline prices. In Orange \\nCounty, consumers were indeed mad, but they weren\\'t the least bit surprised. \\n\\n\\nMotorists interviewed at gas pumps Tuesday said they expected the nation\\'s oil \\ncompanies to take advantage of the Middle East crisis by convincing consumers \\nthat oil supplies are dwindling. But motorist Franco Ferretti was not buying \\nit. \\n\\n\\n\"The oil companies are not overcharging the people -- they\\'re ripping off the \\npeople,\" Ferretti, a Huntington Beach resident, said as he filled his pickup at \\na Costa Mesa Shell station. \"This whole thing in the Middle East looks like a \\nsetup on the part of the oil companies to me.\" \\n\\n\\nFerretti said his two-mile daily commute means that the price increase will \\nhave only a negligible effect on his income. Not so for commuter Danny Palmer. \\n\\n\\n\"I commute from Mission Viejo to Huntington Beach every day,\" Palmer said. \"I \\nhave a Chevy truck that holds 20 to 25 gallons, so I\\'m going to notice it.\" \\n\\n\\nPalmer and other South County residents are going to notice the price increase \\na bit more than other county consumers, according to a random survey conducted \\nby The Times. \\n\\n\\nThe survey of 21 stations revealed an average price of $1.25 for a gallon of \\nunleaded gasoline Tuesday at self-serve pumps in South County stations; the \\naverage price in Central County was $1.20 a gallon, about $1.23 in North \\nCounty. In all regions, prices were up since July 31 an average of 10 cents a \\ngallon -- including a new 5-cent-per-gallon surcharge levied by the state. \\n\\n\\nPrices were even higher for premium unleaded and diesel fuel. Premium prices \\nsoared past $1.40 a gallon at some stations, and diesel fuel prices were up as \\nmuch as 8 cents a gallons since the weekend. \\n\\n\\n\"I think it is outrageous,\" said Jodi Holland, a Huntington Beach resident, \\nwhile her diesel-fueled Mercedes-Benz was being filled at a Huntington Beach \\nTexaco station. \"I have to mortgage my house so I can pay the credit card \\nbill.\" \\n\\n\\nThe Times survey also showed that prices in the same parts of the county varied \\nby up to 11 cents a gallon among gas stations. Jim Daskal, general counsel and \\ndirector of government relations for the Washington-based Service Station \\nDealers of America, attributed the disparity to wild price fluctuations over \\nthe weekend. \\n\\n\\n\"With prices changing almost hourly. . . . you have situations where 10 dealers \\nof the same brand could pay six different (wholesale) prices,\" Daskal said. \"It \\ndepends on when they bought it. Over the weekend, we saw some 7- or 8-cent \\ndifferences between ordering on Sunday evening or Monday morning.\" \\n\\n\\nDaskal said service station owners have reported that the western states, \\nincluding California, have been hit hardest by the increases, which he said \\n\"makes absolutely no sense, considering most of the crude sold in the Southland \\nis coming from Alaska.\" \\n\\n\\nDespite the increases, Daskal said, his organization has received few reports \\nof consumers directing their anger toward station owners, who contend that they \\nare making little profit while the oil companies are raking in millions. \\n\\n\\n\"The customers have been in this situation before, and they expect things like \\nthis to happen,\" said Avo Asyan, owner of Avo\\'s Shell in Costa Mesa. \"We don\\'t \\ncontrol the prices. The oil companies and the suppliers control the prices.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGASOLINE PRICES AT VARIOUS O.C. LOCATIONS \\n\\n\\nGasoline prices in Orange County have increased an average of 10 in the past \\nweek, due to both the crisis in the Middle East and a 5 state tax hike that \\ntook effect last Wednesday. \\n\\n\\nPrices are for one gallon of self-serve, unleaded gasoline paid for with cash. \\nThey are rounded up to the nearest penny. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNORTH COUNTY \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTuesday, \\n\\n \\n\\nTuesday, \\n\\n \\n\\nOne-Week \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\nJuly 31 \\n\\n \\n\\nAug. 7 \\n\\n \\n\\nIncrease \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nARCO, 1490 S.

The draft now enters the parliament. \\n  The draft legislation proposes raising the excise tax on \\ngasoline from the present 0.40 kroons per liter to 0.80 kroons \\nfor ordinary gasoline, and to 0.60 kroons for gasoline \\ncontaining less than 0.013 grams of lead per liter. \\n  Introduction of different rates is aimed at encouraging car \\nowners to use fuel less detrimental to the environment. \\n  The excise tax on diesel fuel is to be hiked from the \\ncurrent \\n0.25 kroons to 0.50 kroons per liter. Rates for aircraft fuel, \\nliquid gas and lubricants are to remain the same. \\n  The government has said the step is mainly due to the need \\nto \\nearn an estimated additional 21.8 million kroons into the state \\ncoffers to pay higher pensions from April. \\n  A representative at the Finance Ministry said the Estonian \\nOil Association, a body connecting the country\\'s fuel companies, \\nhad agreed to the motion. \\n  The Oil Association\\'s managing director, Mart Kutsar, told \\nBNS his association had not approved of the planned step.

A year ago, the comparable \\nprice was $1.11. \\n\\n\\nAlthough consumer groups have complained that oil companies have used the \\nMiddle East crisis to raise pump prices, Trilby Lundberg said her survey did \\nnot support that. \\n\\n\\nLundberg said the dime-per-gallon increase was due to tax increases -- \\nincluding the 5-cent-per-gallon transportation improvement tax that took effect \\nAug. 1 in California -- historically high summer demand and increasing reliance \\non imported refined gasoline, whose price jumped immediately when Iraq invaded \\nKuwait this month. In fact, Lundberg argued, gas retailers have lost nearly a \\ncent of profit margin since the invasion. \\n\\n\\nLundberg said that when Iraq took over Kuwait on Aug. 2, the price of oil and \\nall petroleum products leaped dramatically on the \"spot market,\" the place \\nwhere oil companies and refiners purchase supplies at prices that fluctuate \\ndaily, if not more often. \\n\\n\\nAlthough oil companies have contractual purchase agreements in place for the \\nvast majority of their supplies, Lundberg said that because they do not have \\nsufficient refining capacity of their own, they are increasingly relying on \\nspot market purchases of refined gasoline to meet increased summer demand from \\nvacationing motorists. Further, spot market prices are often used as a \\nbenchmark for setting other prices. \\n\\n\\nShe said the spot gasoline market saw slight price declines at the end of last \\nweek and, if that trend continues, consumers may see a dip in pump prices \\nagain. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

OTHERS ARE \\nCAUGHT UNAWARES. ALMOST ALL ASK, WHAT CAN YOU DO? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnough, already! \\n\\n\\nThat was the sentiment expressed by customers at some Orange County service \\nstations as they were greeted Saturday morning by the federal government\\'s \\nnickel-a-gallon tax increase at the fuel pump. \\n\\n\\n\"I spend a lot of money on gas,\" said Pedra Salcedo of Santa Ana, who commutes \\nevery day from housecleaning jobs in Newport Beach. \"Now, I\\'m just going to \\nhave to work more.\" \\n\\n\\nSalcedo, making a fuel stop at the Arco station on Fairview Street and Edinger \\nAvenue, said she spends between $20 and $25 each week filling up her small \\npickup. The self-serve price for unleaded was $1.33. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s terrible. We have to work so hard anyway. What can I say? One day it\\'s \\n$10 (to fill up) and another day it takes $12.\" \\n\\n\\nInside the station, Julie Wong said business was booming Friday night as \\ncustomers rushed to top off their tanks and beat the increase. Even with \\nSaturday\\'s higher prices, Wong said business Saturday remained steady. \\n\\n\\n\"I think everybody knew about the increase\" Friday night, Wong said. \"But sales \\nhave been good today. Maybe it\\'s because it\\'s the day after payday for some \\npeople.\" \\n\\n\\nJust up the street at an Exxon station, there was more customer exasperation as \\nRaul Saldivar plunked down $10 to pump just less than 8 gallons. \\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s just too much!\" the 28-year-old Saldivar said of the $1.35-a-gallon \\nprice. \"I don\\'t know why this has to happen. I hope, somehow, things will get \\nbetter.\" \\n\\n\\nAt the Mobil station on La Palma Boulevard in Anaheim, an attendant said \\ncustomers are not appeased when informed that the higher prices are the result \\nof a tax increase, not an oil price hike. \\n\\n\\n\"They complain a lot,\" said the attendant, who gave his name only as Ivan. \\n\"They say it\\'s much too expensive now. The government raised the price and not \\nthe company, but they are very, very crazy about it.\" \\n\\n\\nPrices for customers who paid cash ranged from $1.35 a gallon for regular \\nleaded gasoline to $1.37 for unleaded and $1.55 for super unleaded, he said. \\n\\n\\nElsewhere throughout Southern California, motorists\\' reaction to the new \\nfederal excise tax ranged from anger to resignation. \\n\\n\\n\"The government already takes out so much in taxes,\" said Tiffany Lee, 22, a \\nmodel, who filled her Hyundai Sonata at an Arco station in Los Angeles\\' \\nKoreatown. \"It doesn\\'t seem fair that they\\'re going after more tax money. This \\nmuch more we have to pay? With the economy so slow, it makes you think there\\'s \\nsomething wrong with George Bush.\" \\n\\n\\nThe new tax brings the national average of unleaded regular gas at self-service \\nstations to $1.41 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Assn. \\n\\n\\nWhile pumping unleaded gas priced at $1.45 per gallon, a 33-year-old municipal \\nbond trader from Pasadena also lamented the uneasy state of the nation\\'s \\neconomy, saying that her husband had just been laid off. \\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s an investment banker, and his future job prospects look pretty (bad) \\nright now,\" said the woman, who asked not to be identified. To augment the \\nhousehold income, she had to go back to work last week at a downtown brokerage \\nfirm after several months off. \\n\\n\\nThe price hike will squeeze her family\\'s single income all the more, the woman \\nsaid. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'m not happy with the tax, but what else can the government do?\" she asked. \\n\"With the budget deficit so high, you can cut back, cut back, cut back only so \\nmuch. It\\'s ridiculous to think you can balance it without raising taxes.\" \\n\\n\\nThe tax is estimated to generate $5 billion a year, half of which will go \\ntoward road and public transportation improvements. The other half will be used \\nto whittle down the nation\\'s $250-billion budget deficit. \\n\\n\\nIn Chatsworth, Kim Oswald, 28, said she went to five gas stations looking for \\nthe lowest price before stopping at an Arco station. The price for regular \\nleaded gas: $1.27. \\n\\n\\n\"Some of us are barely making it as it is,\" Oswald said as she filled up a \\nwell-worn Pontiac Bonneville. \\n\\n\\nMany Ventura County motorists were not fazed by the tax hike, saying that \\nthey\\'ve learned to live with the steeper gasoline prices. Several people \\nfilling their tanks at a Shell station in mid-town Ventura said they could \\nenvision gas prices going to $2 a gallon. \\n\\n\\n\"I\\'ll just keep driving,\" said Nigel Thornell, 46, a medical lab specialist \\nfrom Santa Barbara. \"There isn\\'t much choice.\" \\n\\n\\nFernando Gamua, manager of Seaward Mobil in Ventura, said people initially were \\nannoyed by a nickel-a-gallon state tax increase in August and since have \\naccepted the escalating costs during the Persian Gulf crisis. \\n\\n\\nStill, motorists lined up Friday night at Argett Chevron in Ventura to fill up \\ntheir tanks before the price hike took effect at midnight, said Josh Nudd, a \\nstation attendant. \\n\\n\\nOn Saturday, \"Some people were kind of upset and wished they\\'d come in last \\nnight,\" Nudd said. \\n\\n\\nMore than the extra 5 cents per gallon, motorists seemed to be dismayed at \\nhaving no say over Congress\\' action to increase taxes in its budget agreement. \\nSome were upset that President Bush has not been held accountable to his \\ncampaign promises of no new taxes. \\n\\n\\n\"Everything he promised he was going to do, he hasn\\'t followed through on,\" \\nsaid the Pasadena bond broker. \"I\\'m not happy with him at all. And I\\'m a \\nRepublican.\" \\n\\n\\nTimes staff writers Sonni Efron, Christopher Pummer and Amy Louise Kazmin also \\ncontributed to this story. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",

THE FINDINGS RAISE \\nDOUBTS ABOUT BUSH\\'S CALL FOR LEGISLATURES TO PLAY A GREATER FUNDING ROLE. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nState and local governments are bearing an increasing share of the burden of \\nrebuilding the nation\\'s highways and bridges, and states have raised their gas \\ntaxes 122 times since 1980, according to a survey released today. \\n\\n\\nAlthough the survey was simply intended to provide statistical information, it \\nraises questions about the feasibility of the Bush Administration\\'s recent call \\nfor states and local governments to play an even greater role in highway \\nconstruction and maintenance. \\n\\n\\nThe Road Information Program (TRIP), a nonprofit Washington-based \\ntransportation research institute, said its survey found that state and local \\ngovernments bore 77.6% of the cost of highway improvements in 1988, compared to \\n74% in 1980. That represented state expenditures of $53.53 billion in 1988, \\ncompared to $28.54 billion in 1980. \\n\\n\\nThe survey also found that states have already boosted their gas taxes by an \\naverage 84% -- from 8.6 cents a gallon in 1980 to 15.8 cents a gallon by Jan. \\n1, 1990. Some states have raised their gas taxes three or more times during \\nthat period, including Wisconsin (five times), Minnesota and Indiana (four) and \\nSouth Carolina and Nevada (three), the report said. \\n\\n\\nIn California, TRIP\\'s findings were hailed by proponents of a June ballot \\ninitiative to double the state\\'s 9-cent-a-gallon gas tax over five years. If \\nvoters approve Proposition 111, the revenues generated would be dedicated to \\nhighway improvements. \\n\\n\\nArthur Bauer, executive director of Californians for Better Transportation, a \\ngroup that favors Proposition 111, said the report shows that California lags \\nbehind the nation in increasing its gas sales tax. \\n\\n\\n\"Some states already have 20-cent gas taxes,\" he said. \"We\\'re hoping to get to \\n18 cents over the next five years. This helps illustrate the differences \\nbetween states.\" \\n\\n\\nTRIP collected the data contained in the report by surveying highway \\ndepartments in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as using \\ninformation supplied by the Federal Highway Administration, the American Assn. \\nof State Highway and Transportation Officials and other government and private \\norganizations. \\n\\n\\n\"This report is a response to the Administration\\'s saying that the states have \\nto pick up more funding responsibility,\" said Sally Thompson, a TRIP researcher \\nand the report\\'s author. \"What they\\'ve been calling for may not be possible \\nsince the states have been picking up the responsibility all along.\" \\n\\n\\nLast month, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner released the \\nAdministration\\'s national transportation policy, which outlined the \\ndeteriorating status of the nation\\'s infrastructure but offered no federal \\nprograms or methods to pay for needed repairs. Instead, the policy urged state \\nlegislatures to offset a diminished federal role by increasing state taxes, \\nseeking private-sector involvement and employing innovative financial deals for \\nhighway projects. \\n\\n\\nBut TRIP\\'s report said many state governments are already trying to compensate \\nfor less federal aid with the kind of programs called for in the \\nAdministration\\'s national transportation policy. \\n\\n\\nIt added that the states are just as strapped for money as the federal \\ngovernment, and often end up using highway funds for other purposes. \\n\\n\\n\"Money collected from user charges such as motor-fuel taxes and registration \\nfees is being diverted to unrelated areas, such as mass transit, education and \\nlaw enforcement,\" the report said. \"In fact, 18 states considered legislation \\n(to allow diversions of highway funds) in 1989 and 11 passed legislation.\" \\n\\n\\nTRIP researchers asked state officials to list their \"top three highway\" \\npriorities, and 30 of the 41 responding to the question \"spoke of the need for \\nstronger federal support,\" the report said. \\n\\n\\nThe state officials\\' response was \"in direct contrast\" to the Administration\\'s \\n\"call for an increased state role,\" Thompson said. However, the report also \\nnoted that \"states are reluctantly accepting the fact that the federal \\ngovernment is not going to provide the regular, adequate highway funding they \\ndesperately need -- not now and not in future years.\" \\n\\n\\nThe survey also showed that state officials are strongly opposed to increasing \\nthe federal gas tax to reduce the deficit, as has been suggested in Washington \\nrecently. \\n\\n\\n\"A total of 41 respondents said such a tax would have a devastating impact on \\ntheir highway programs,\" the report said. It noted that 29 states passed \\nresolutions last year opposing a federal gas tax increase to reduce the budget \\ndeficit. \\n\\n\\nState officials are more inclined to support the spending of federal motor fuel \\ntaxes already collected and held in the Highway Trust Fund, the report said. \\n\\n\\n\"We would like to see (the Administration) spend down the Highway Trust Fund,\" \\nArt Taylor, a spokesman for the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department, \\nsaid in an interview. \"Once that money is spent down, we\\'re not opposed to the \\nfederal government raising its gasoline tax.\" \\n\\n\\nThe fund has a surplus of about $10 billion and it grows yearly since receipts \\ncontinue to outpace expenditures by about $2 billion a year. \\n\\n\\n', 'spans': []}\n",
