According to \\nVECER, 1,036 respondents were classified by age and residence, but \\nthe paper did not explain the methodology or give the margin of \\nerror.  For the purpose of comparison, the paper cited the results \\nof an unidentified poll made in May 1993. The approval/disapproval \\nratings, in percent, for ten Macedonian politicians were: \\n\\n                                           November 1993    May 1993 \\n\\nKiro Gligorov, President of the Republic      76/15           78/13 \\n\\nVasil Tupurkovski, former Macedonian          50/36           43/37 \\n   official in Federal Yugoslavia \\n\\nLjubomir Frckovski, Interior Minister         50/42           42/43 \\n\\nStojan Andov, Parliamentary Chairman          48/41           48/39 \\n\\nBranko Crvenkovski, Prime Minister            46/41           44/38 \\n\\nVlado Popovski, Defense Minister              41/41           36/37 \\n\\nStevo Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister           40/43   No Data Given \\n\\nPetar Gosev, Democratic Party leader          34/53           40/42 \\n\\nTodor Petrov, Independent parliamentarian     32/53   No Data Given \\n\\nNikola Popovski, Social Democratic            29/46           32/42 \\n   Party parliamentarian \\n\\n   VECER noted that President Gligorov\\'s very high approval rating \\nof 90 percent among those over age 65 fell off to a still high 70 \\npercent among respondents between 18 and 24.  Residents of Skopje \\nranked the politicians in a slightly different order from the \\nranking given by the whole sample: Gligorov, Tupurkovski, Frckovski, \\nAndov, Gosev, Branko Crvenkovski, Vlado Popovski, Petrov, Nikola \\nPopovski, and Stevo Crvenkovski. \\n\\n   The results of a series of opinion polls conducted by the Agency \\nfor Public Opinion Research and published \"exclusively\" by the \\nSkopje weekly PULS newspaper, confirmed Gligorov\\'s substantial lead \\nin popularity among political figures.

According \\nto Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief \\ndelegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone \\nmessage to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 \\nMarch.  Pyongyang\\'s attempt to delay the North-South meeting for \\ntwo days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached \\nwith Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks.  The \\n25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 \\nFebruary, specified 1 March as the date the following will take \\nplace \"simultaneously\": \\n\\n   + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year\\'s \\nrunning of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent \\nto Seoul\\'s decision. \\n\\n   + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear \\ninspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. \\n\\n   + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss \\nexchanging of special presidential envoys. \\n\\n   + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level \\nbilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. \\n\\n   Pyongyang\\'s Motives In proposing a later date for North-South \\ncontacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about \\nappearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear \\ninspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but \\nWashington on the nuclear issue.  In the latest attempt to \\nportray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper \\nNodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President \\nKim Yong-sam for allegedly acting \"as if he receives U.S. reports \\non DPRK-U.S. talks\" and \"as if he controls the talks\" (Pyongyang \\nradio, 28 February).  Kim creates this impression, the commentary \\nadded, even though \"he is not even qualified to join the talks.\" \\n\\n   Pyongyang\\'s reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance \\nwas also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North \\nKorea expressed in commenting on Kim\\'s 25 February press \\nconference commemorating the first year of his presidency. \\nDeparting from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal \\nattacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean \\ndialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped \\nabuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a \"traitor,\" a \\n\"puppet,\" and a \"political mountebank,\" accusing him of \"arch \\ncrimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression,\" and \\npromoting national \"division and confrontation,\" and  of plain \\n\"stupidity.\"  KCNA went on to claim that Kim\\'s remarks about the \\nprobable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal \\nfor an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that \\nhis \"criminal\" policy \"against the North\" had been wrong.

According \\nto Pyongyang radio on 1 March, Pak Yong-su, North Korean chief \\ndelegate to the proposed working-level talks, sent a telephone \\nmessage to his Southern counterpart proposing a meeting on 3 \\nMarch.  Pyongyang\\'s attempt to delay the North-South meeting for \\ntwo days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached \\nwith Washington for resumption of high-level DPRK-U.S talks.  The \\n25 February agreement, announced by Pyongyang radio on 28 \\nFebruary, specified 1 March as the date the following will take \\nplace \"simultaneously\": \\n\\n   + Seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this year\\'s \\nrunning of Team Spirit and Washington will announce its consent \\nto Seoul\\'s decision. \\n\\n   + The International Atomic Energy Agency will start nuclear \\ninspections in the North to ensure continuity of safeguards. \\n\\n   + Inter-Korean contacts will start at Panmunjom to discuss \\nexchanging of special presidential envoys. \\n\\n   + Pyongyang and Washington will announce resumption of high-level \\nbilateral talks to take place on 21 March in Geneva. \\n\\n   Pyongyang\\'s Motives In proposing a later date for North-South \\ncontacts, Pyongyang may have been showing its concern about \\nappearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear \\ninspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but \\nWashington on the nuclear issue.  In the latest attempt to \\nportray Seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue, the party paper \\nNodong Sinmun in a 28 February commentary ridiculed ROK President \\nKim Yong-sam for allegedly acting \"as if he receives U.S. reports \\non DPRK-U.S. talks\" and \"as if he controls the talks\" (Pyongyang \\nradio, 28 February).  Kim creates this impression, the commentary \\nadded, even though \"he is not even qualified to join the talks.\" \\n\\n   Pyongyang\\'s reluctance to engage Seoul in anything of substance \\nwas also evident in the sheer contempt for President Kim North \\nKorea expressed in commenting on Kim\\'s 25 February press \\nconference commemorating the first year of his presidency. \\nDeparting from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal \\nattacks on South Korean leaders during periods of inter-Korean \\ndialogue, the North Korean news agency KCNA on 27 February heaped \\nabuse on President Kim, calling him, inter alia, a \"traitor,\" a \\n\"puppet,\" and a \"political mountebank,\" accusing him of \"arch \\ncrimes of flunkeyism, treachery, fascism, repression,\" and \\npromoting national \"division and confrontation,\" and  of plain \\n\"stupidity.\"  KCNA went on to claim that Kim\\'s remarks about the \\nprobable absence of nuclear arms in the North and his proposal \\nfor an inter-Korean summit constituted a de facto admission that \\nhis \"criminal\" policy \"against the North\" had been wrong.  The \\nparty paper Nodong Sinmun on 28 February similarly ridiculed \\nKim\\'s \"preposterously absurd remarks\" (Pyongyang radio). \\n\\n   DPRK-U.S. Talks In sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet \\nwith Seoul, Pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming \\ntalks with Washington.

Joined by Russian media commentators, they have \\ncriticized the involvement of high-level U.S. officials in \\npublicizing the case, saying that the case involves normal \\nespionage activity that all countries pursue.  In addition, \\nRussian media across the political spectrum have viewed U.S. \\nhandling of the incident as evidence of a U.S. desire to \\nmarginalize Russia\\'s international role. \\n\\n                            END SUMMARY \\n\\n   In their initial public statements on the Ames case, Russian \\nofficials have consistently tried to minimize the incident\\'s \\nimpact on U.S.-Russian relations.  They have decried the \\npublicity given to the case by high-level U.S. officials, saying \\nthat incidents such as the Ames case should be handled by \\nintelligence agencies without involving officials at higher \\nlevels: \\n\\n   -- According to ITAR-TASS on 24 February, Foreign Minister Andrey \\nKozyrev said that it would be better to let the intelligence \\nservices handle the case and \"not to politicize or ideologize the \\nsituation.\"  He emphasized that it is important for the United \\nStates and Russia to continue to \"cooperate and not to attach \\nundue, hypertrophied significance to this case.\"  After the \\nRussians expelled a U.S. Embassy officer in retaliation for the \\nU.S. expulsion of a Russian Embassy official in Washington, \\nKozyrev reiterated these views and claimed Moscow \"had to resort\" \\nto a reciprocal expulsion but this process of \"reciprocity\" \\nshould be eliminated, \"the sooner the better\" (ITAR-TASS, 28 \\nFebruary). \\n\\n   -- A 25 February Foreign Ministry press statement sniped at U.S. \\nhandling of the case, criticizing \"attempts by the special \\nservices to drag the political leadership into their mutual \\nrelations,\" and noted that there are \"appropriate channels\" that \\ncan be \"brought fully\" into use to deal with such cases.  The \\nstatement said that if, as reported, the investigation of Ames \\nhad begun ten months ago, \"this was sufficient time for us to be \\ncontacted directly\" and for U.S. officials to \"share their \\nanxieties with us before making them public\" (ITAR-TASS, 25 \\nFebruary). \\n\\n   -- Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) officials refused \\nto comment directly on Ames, but expressed surprise that the \\nUnited States made such an outcry over actions FIS officials \\ndescribed as common practice for all intelligence services.  FIS \\ndirector Yevgeniy Primakov had \"no comment\" on the case (ITAR- \\nTASS, 23 February).  FIS press spokesman Yuriy Kobaladze noted \\nthat declining to comment on such allegations is the general \\npractice among intelligence services and stressed \"there is \\nnothing new or sensational here in the fact that countries engage \\nin intelligence activities\" (Moscow radio, Russian TV, 23 \\nFebruary).  He went on to claim that neither the United States \\nnor Russia had \"ever pledged to curtail intelligence activity\" \\nand that Washington has \"been very active\" in intelligence \\nactivity in Russia and the other newly independent states. \\n\\n   Breaking ranks, at least temporarily, with other officials, \\nMikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, \\nacknowledged Ames\\' links to Russia but later retracted this \\nadmission.  A 26 February ITAR-TASS report quoted Kolesnikov as \\nsaying \"Ames worked in the UnitedStates for Russia\" but \\nnonetheless claiming that he had \"inflicted no direct damage\" on \\nthe United States.  On 28 February, however, Kolesnikov stated \\nthat the General Staff and its intelligence service \"have no \\ninformation on any links\" between Ames and Soviet or Russian \\nintelligence agencies.  According to ITAR-TASS, Kolesnikov went \\non to claim that \"U.S. media misinterpreted\" his 26 February \\nstatement (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). \\n\\n   Russian Media \\n\\n   Russian media across the political spectrum indignantly \\ncriticized U.S. handling of the case and speculated, sometimes on \\nthe basis of comments by unnamed officials, that the United \\nStates had ulterior motives in timing the public exposure of \\nAmes.  Some commentators said that U.S. officials had exposed the \\ncase now because they wanted to create a pretext to reevaluate \\nU.S.-Russian relations in the wake of the recent slowdown of \\nreform in Russia, while others alleged that the United States \\nwanted to take the gloss off Russia\\'s diplomatic success in \\nbrokering a compromise over Sarajevo.  Media commentary, even in \\npublications like Izvestiya, a strong supporter of Russian \\nefforts to integrate with the West, supported the Russian \\ngovernment position and criticized the United States: \\n\\n   -- A 24 February article in Izvestiya remarked on what it saw as \\nthe \"hypocrisy\" of U.S. reaction to the Ames case, since, it \\nclaimed, Russia \"has no less right to secret operations in the \\nUnited States than America has to espionage in Russia.\"  A 25 \\nFebruary article on the case headlined the question \"Why Is \\nWashington Making a Fuss?\" and cited \"competent sources\" as \\nspeculating that the Ames\\' arrest was an attempt to put Moscow in \\nits \"place\" after Russian diplomacy in Bosnia for the first time \\nin recent years \"cast the United States in a secondary role.\" \\n\\n   -- A 25 February article in the government newspaper Rossiyskaya \\nGazeta worried that the Ames case is being given \"political \\novertones\" reminiscent of the 1960 U-2 incident, which triggered \\na sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations.  The article claimed \\nthat \"certain forces\" in the United States were trying to \\n\"exaggerate this affair\" because they are unhappy with the new \\nChernomyrdin government and with Yeltsin\\'s Bosnia initiative, \\nwhich had \"thwarted the hawks\\' attempt to resolve the Serbian \\nquestion through air strikes\" and had \"suddenly and very sharply\" \\nincreased Russia\\'s \"political weight in the international arena.\" \\nThe article concluded, however, that both the U.S. and Russian \\npresidents were demonstrating a \"well-balanced approach\" and \\nexpressed hope that political relations between the two countries \\nwould not be aggravated. \\n\\n   -- A 25 February article in the Defense Ministry\\'s newspaper \\nKrasnaya Zvezda cited several theories advanced by unnamed \\n\"experts\" to explain the U.S. \"ballyhoo\" over the case.  The \\narticle claimed U.S. intelligence agencies wished to get even \\nafter the exposure of more than 2O foreign intelligence agents, \\nincluding U.S. spies, in the last year.  An article on 26 \\nFebruary charged that the \"fuss\" over the \"routine event\" of a \\ndouble agent\\'s exposure is taking on an \"increasingly hysterical \\ncharacter\" in the United States, claiming with obvious sarcasm \\nthat \"Langley believes that only [its agents] have the right to \\ncarry out intelligence activity.\"  Prominent Krasnaya Zvezda \\nobserver Aleksandr Golts, in a commentary published on 1 March, \\nimplicitly took issue with this analysis, however, claiming \\ninstead that it is Russia\\'s newly demonstrated foreign policy \\nindependence that has \"driven Washington berserk.\"  Golts \\ncontended that the United States is publicizing the Ames case \\nbecause Russia\\'s efforts to \"implement an active foreign policy \\ncourse\" with its \"successful initiative in the Balkans\" had put \\nthe United States \"on the sidelines\" after it had become \\naccustomed to \"feeling that it is the only world leader, the only \\nsuperpower.\"  He concluded by advocating the \"vital necessity\" of \\na \"partnership\" with the \"rules of conduct. .. the same for \\neveryone. \\n\\n   -- The independent pro-reform newspaper Segodnya, in a 24 \\nFebruary article, warned that the Ames case would revive the \"old \\noutcry\" that the \"Russians cannot be trusted.\"  The article \\nlinked the case to Yeltsin\\'s Bosnia initiative, particularly his \\nproposal for a summit on the issue.  Claiming that Yeltsin\\'s \\nsummit proposal would be \"inconvenient\" for Western leaders, the \\narticle implied that the Ames \"scandal\" had been whipped up to \\n\"remove the Russian initiative from the agenda.\"  A 1 March \\narticle cited unnamed sources as saying that Russian security \\nservices \"are not interested in arousing passions,\" but that \\n\"influential U.S. forces\" are hoping to \"impose a time-out\" for \\nthe United States to reexamine its policy toward Russia. \\n\\n   -- In an interview published in the 26 February edition of the \\nlabor-oriented newspaper Trud, retired KGB Major General Boris \\nSolomatin, citing examples of other spy cases where there was no \\nofficial outcry, bitterly ascribed what he called Washington\\'s \\n\"inappropriate reaction\" to the Ames affair to U.S. \"imperial \\nthinking\" about Russia.  Lamenting that Russia had been \\n\"transformed\" from an equal power whose intelligence services \\ncould work against those of the United States to one which now \\n\"has to ask permission to do so,\" Solomatin complained that the \\nU.S. attitude is \"we can, you cannot\" because \"we have the money\" \\nand \"you have an outstretched hand.\"  Contending that the United \\nStates had not given much thought to the possible consequences \\nwhen it \"embarked on this scandal,\" Solomatin claimed that now, \\nwhen Russians see that the \"big bucks\" spent on intelligence are \\n\"working,\" they will recognize the importance of intelligence and \\nbegin to \"organize it properly.\" \\n\\n   Implications \\n\\n   The pains taken by Russian officials to play down the Ames affair \\nand to minimize its effect on U.S.-Russian relations clearly \\nindicate Moscow\\'s desire to keep the relationship on a firm \\nfooting.  However, the indignant reaction on the part of both \\nofficials and the media to the U.S. handling of the case, as well \\nas the sensitivity displayed toward perceived attempts to \\nrelegate Russia to a marginal role in diplomacy or intelligence \\nactivities, indicates that Moscow will continue to assert itself \\nwhen it feels that the United States is trying to take unfair \\nadvantage. \\n\\n(AUTHOR:  BELLINGER.

They have decried the \\npublicity given to the case by high-level U.S. officials, saying \\nthat incidents such as the Ames case should be handled by \\nintelligence agencies without involving officials at higher \\nlevels: \\n\\n   -- According to ITAR-TASS on 24 February, Foreign Minister Andrey \\nKozyrev said that it would be better to let the intelligence \\nservices handle the case and \"not to politicize or ideologize the \\nsituation.\"  He emphasized that it is important for the United \\nStates and Russia to continue to \"cooperate and not to attach \\nundue, hypertrophied significance to this case.\"  After the \\nRussians expelled a U.S. Embassy officer in retaliation for the \\nU.S. expulsion of a Russian Embassy official in Washington, \\nKozyrev reiterated these views and claimed Moscow \"had to resort\" \\nto a reciprocal expulsion but this process of \"reciprocity\" \\nshould be eliminated, \"the sooner the better\" (ITAR-TASS, 28 \\nFebruary). \\n\\n   -- A 25 February Foreign Ministry press statement sniped at U.S. \\nhandling of the case, criticizing \"attempts by the special \\nservices to drag the political leadership into their mutual \\nrelations,\" and noted that there are \"appropriate channels\" that \\ncan be \"brought fully\" into use to deal with such cases.  The \\nstatement said that if, as reported, the investigation of Ames \\nhad begun ten months ago, \"this was sufficient time for us to be \\ncontacted directly\" and for U.S. officials to \"share their \\nanxieties with us before making them public\" (ITAR-TASS, 25 \\nFebruary). \\n\\n   -- Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) officials refused \\nto comment directly on Ames, but expressed surprise that the \\nUnited States made such an outcry over actions FIS officials \\ndescribed as common practice for all intelligence services.  FIS \\ndirector Yevgeniy Primakov had \"no comment\" on the case (ITAR- \\nTASS, 23 February).  FIS press spokesman Yuriy Kobaladze noted \\nthat declining to comment on such allegations is the general \\npractice among intelligence services and stressed \"there is \\nnothing new or sensational here in the fact that countries engage \\nin intelligence activities\" (Moscow radio, Russian TV, 23 \\nFebruary).  He went on to claim that neither the United States \\nnor Russia had \"ever pledged to curtail intelligence activity\" \\nand that Washington has \"been very active\" in intelligence \\nactivity in Russia and the other newly independent states. \\n\\n   Breaking ranks, at least temporarily, with other officials, \\nMikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General Staff, \\nacknowledged Ames\\' links to Russia but later retracted this \\nadmission.  A 26 February ITAR-TASS report quoted Kolesnikov as \\nsaying \"Ames worked in the UnitedStates for Russia\" but \\nnonetheless claiming that he had \"inflicted no direct damage\" on \\nthe United States.  On 28 February, however, Kolesnikov stated \\nthat the General Staff and its intelligence service \"have no \\ninformation on any links\" between Ames and Soviet or Russian \\nintelligence agencies.  According to ITAR-TASS, Kolesnikov went \\non to claim that \"U.S. media misinterpreted\" his 26 February \\nstatement (ITAR-TASS, 28 February). \\n\\n   Russian Media \\n\\n   Russian media across the political spectrum indignantly \\ncriticized U.S. handling of the case and speculated, sometimes on \\nthe basis of comments by unnamed officials, that the United \\nStates had ulterior motives in timing the public exposure of \\nAmes.  Some commentators said that U.S. officials had exposed the \\ncase now because they wanted to create a pretext to reevaluate \\nU.S.-Russian relations in the wake of the recent slowdown of \\nreform in Russia, while others alleged that the United States \\nwanted to take the gloss off Russia\\'s diplomatic success in \\nbrokering a compromise over Sarajevo.  Media commentary, even in \\npublications like Izvestiya, a strong supporter of Russian \\nefforts to integrate with the West, supported the Russian \\ngovernment position and criticized the United States: \\n\\n   -- A 24 February article in Izvestiya remarked on what it saw as \\nthe \"hypocrisy\" of U.S. reaction to the Ames case, since, it \\nclaimed, Russia \"has no less right to secret operations in the \\nUnited States than America has to espionage in Russia.\"  A 25 \\nFebruary article on the case headlined the question \"Why Is \\nWashington Making a Fuss?\" and cited \"competent sources\" as \\nspeculating that the Ames\\' arrest was an attempt to put Moscow in \\nits \"place\" after Russian diplomacy in Bosnia for the first time \\nin recent years \"cast the United States in a secondary role.\" \\n\\n   -- A 25 February article in the government newspaper Rossiyskaya \\nGazeta worried that the Ames case is being given \"political \\novertones\" reminiscent of the 1960 U-2 incident, which triggered \\na sharp downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations.  The article claimed \\nthat \"certain forces\" in the United States were trying to \\n\"exaggerate this affair\" because they are unhappy with the new \\nChernomyrdin government and with Yeltsin\\'s Bosnia initiative, \\nwhich had \"thwarted the hawks\\' attempt to resolve the Serbian \\nquestion through air strikes\" and had \"suddenly and very sharply\" \\nincreased Russia\\'s \"political weight in the international arena.\" \\nThe article concluded, however, that both the U.S. and Russian \\npresidents were demonstrating a \"well-balanced approach\" and \\nexpressed hope that political relations between the two countries \\nwould not be aggravated. \\n\\n   -- A 25 February article in the Defense Ministry\\'s newspaper \\nKrasnaya Zvezda cited several theories advanced by unnamed \\n\"experts\" to explain the U.S. \"ballyhoo\" over the case.  The \\narticle claimed U.S. intelligence agencies wished to get even \\nafter the exposure of more than 2O foreign intelligence agents, \\nincluding U.S. spies, in the last year.  An article on 26 \\nFebruary charged that the \"fuss\" over the \"routine event\" of a \\ndouble agent\\'s exposure is taking on an \"increasingly hysterical \\ncharacter\" in the United States, claiming with obvious sarcasm \\nthat \"Langley believes that only [its agents] have the right to \\ncarry out intelligence activity.\"  Prominent Krasnaya Zvezda \\nobserver Aleksandr Golts, in a commentary published on 1 March, \\nimplicitly took issue with this analysis, however, claiming \\ninstead that it is Russia\\'s newly demonstrated foreign policy \\nindependence that has \"driven Washington berserk.\"  Golts \\ncontended that the United States is publicizing the Ames case \\nbecause Russia\\'s efforts to \"implement an active foreign policy \\ncourse\" with its \"successful initiative in the Balkans\" had put \\nthe United States \"on the sidelines\" after it had become \\naccustomed to \"feeling that it is the only world leader, the only \\nsuperpower.\"  He concluded by advocating the \"vital necessity\" of \\na \"partnership\" with the \"rules of conduct. .. the same for \\neveryone. \\n\\n   -- The independent pro-reform newspaper Segodnya, in a 24 \\nFebruary article, warned that the Ames case would revive the \"old \\noutcry\" that the \"Russians cannot be trusted.\"  The article \\nlinked the case to Yeltsin\\'s Bosnia initiative, particularly his \\nproposal for a summit on the issue.  Claiming that Yeltsin\\'s \\nsummit proposal would be \"inconvenient\" for Western leaders, the \\narticle implied that the Ames \"scandal\" had been whipped up to \\n\"remove the Russian initiative from the agenda.\"  A 1 March \\narticle cited unnamed sources as saying that Russian security \\nservices \"are not interested in arousing passions,\" but that \\n\"influential U.S. forces\" are hoping to \"impose a time-out\" for \\nthe United States to reexamine its policy toward Russia. \\n\\n   -- In an interview published in the 26 February edition of the \\nlabor-oriented newspaper Trud, retired KGB Major General Boris \\nSolomatin, citing examples of other spy cases where there was no \\nofficial outcry, bitterly ascribed what he called Washington\\'s \\n\"inappropriate reaction\" to the Ames affair to U.S. \"imperial \\nthinking\" about Russia.  Lamenting that Russia had been \\n\"transformed\" from an equal power whose intelligence services \\ncould work against those of the United States to one which now \\n\"has to ask permission to do so,\" Solomatin complained that the \\nU.S. attitude is \"we can, you cannot\" because \"we have the money\" \\nand \"you have an outstretched hand.\"  Contending that the United \\nStates had not given much thought to the possible consequences \\nwhen it \"embarked on this scandal,\" Solomatin claimed that now, \\nwhen Russians see that the \"big bucks\" spent on intelligence are \\n\"working,\" they will recognize the importance of intelligence and \\nbegin to \"organize it properly.\" \\n\\n   Implications \\n\\n   The pains taken by Russian officials to play down the Ames affair \\nand to minimize its effect on U.S.-Russian relations clearly \\nindicate Moscow\\'s desire to keep the relationship on a firm \\nfooting.  However, the indignant reaction on the part of both \\nofficials and the media to the U.S. handling of the case, as well \\nas the sensitivity displayed toward perceived attempts to \\nrelegate Russia to a marginal role in diplomacy or intelligence \\nactivities, indicates that Moscow will continue to assert itself \\nwhen it feels that the United States is trying to take unfair \\nadvantage. \\n\\n(AUTHOR:  BELLINGER.
