It consists of a trilogy of storylines that ran from 1993 to 1994, consisting of ``Knightfall'', ``Knightquest'', and ``KnightsEnd''. The story takes place over approximately six months. Bruce Wayne (Batman) suffers burnout and is systematically assaulted and crippled by a ``super steroid''-enhanced genius named Bane. Wayne is replaced as Batman by an apprentice named Jean-Paul Valley (a.k.a. Azrael), who becomes increasingly violent and unstable, tarnishing Batman's reputation. Eventually, Wayne is healed through paranormal means, and reclaims his role as Batman. ``Knightfall'' resulted in long-term ramifications for the Batman continuity, as Batman's trust from the police, the public, and fellow superheroes had to be rebuilt, due to Azrael's violence. Additionally, Wayne realizes the peril and burden of attempting to work in solitude, leading to the eventual creation of the modern incarnation of the Batman family. The events of Knightfall also led to the resignation of Wayne's loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth. The entire ``Knightfall'' storyline took over a year to complete in the comic book serials.
